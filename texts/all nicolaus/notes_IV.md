# The Chapter on Capital (continuation)

##### *Confusion of profit and surplus value. Carey's erroneous calculation. -- The capitalist, who does* not pay *the worker for the* preservation *of the old value, then demands remuneration for giving the worker permission to preserve the old capital. -- Surplus value and profit etc. -- Difference between consumption of the instrument and of wages. The former consumed in the production process, the latter outside it. -- Increase of surplus value and decrease in rate of profit. (Bastiat)*

This highly irksome calculation will not delay us further. The point is simply this: if, as in our first example, material and instrument amount to 3/5 (60 out of 100), and wages 2/5 (40), and if the capital yielded a gain of 40%, then it equals 140 at the end (this 40% gain equal to the fact that the capitalist made the workers put out 12 hours of labour, where 6 were necessary, hence gained 100% on the necessary labour time). Now if the 40 thalers which were gained go to work again as capital with the same presuppositions -- and at the present point, the presuppositions have not changed yet -- then of the 40 thalers 3/5 i.e. 24 thalers have to be used for material and instrument, and 2/5 for labour; so that the only thing that doubles is the wage of 16 which becomes 32, 16 for reproduction, 16 surplus labour; so that altogether at the end of production 40 + 16 = 56 or 40%. Thus the entire capital of 40 would have produced 196 under the same conditions. It should not be assumed, as happens in most of the economics books, that the 40 thalers are spent purely for wages, to buy living labour, and thus yield 80 thalers at the end of production.

\<If it is said: a capital of 100 yields 10% in one period, 5% in another, then nothing is more mistaken than to conclude, as do Carey and consorts, that the share of capital in production was 1/10 and that of labour 9/10 in the first case; in the second case, the share[]{#p374} of capital only 1/20 and that of labour 19/20; i.e. that the share of labour rises as the rate of profit falls.[^1] From the viewpoint of capital -- and capital has no awareness whatever of the nature of its process of realization, and has an interest in having an awareness of it only in times of *crisis* -- a profit of 10% on a capital of 100 looks like a profit on each of its value components -- material, instrument, wages -- equally and indifferently, as if this capital were simply a sum of 100 thalers of value which had, as such, increased by 10%. But the question is, in fact: (1) what was the relation between the component parts of capital and (2) how much surplus labour did it buy with the wage -- with the hours of labour objectified in the wage? If I know the total size of a capital, the relation of its value components to one another (in practice, I would also have to know what part of the instrument of production is used up in the process, i.e. actually enters into it), and if I know the profit, then I know how much surplus labour has been created. If 3/5 of the capital consisted of material (which for the sake of convenience we here suppose to be entirely consumed productively as material of production), i.e. 60 thalers, and wages 40, and if the profit on the 100 thalers is 10, then the labour bought for 40 thalers of objectified labour time has created 50 thalers of objectified labour in the production process, hence has worked a surplus labour time or created a surplus value of 25% = 1/4 of the necessary labour time. Then if the worker works a day of 12 hours, he has worked 3 hours of surplus time, and the labour time necessary to maintain him alive for one day was 9 hours of labour. The new value created in production may only be 10 thalers, but, according to the real rate, these 10 thalers are to be reckoned on the base of the 40, not of the 100. The 60 thalers of value have created no value whatever; the working day has. Thus the worker has increased the part of capital spent for labour capacity by 25%, not by 10%. The total capital has grown by 10%. 10 is 25% of 40; it is only 10% of 100. Thus the profit rate on capital in no way expresses the rate at which living labour increases objective labour; for this increase is merely = to the surplus with which the worker reproduces his wage, i.e. = to the time which he works over and above that which he would have to work in order to reproduce his wages. If the worker in the above example were not a worker for a capitalist, and if he related to the use values contained in the 100 thalers not as to capital but simply as to the objective conditions of his labour, then, before beginning[]{#p375} the production process anew, he would possess 40 thalers in subsistence, which he would consume during the working day, and 60 thalers in instrument and material. He would work only 3/4 of a day, 9 hours, and at the end of the day his product would be not 110 thalers but 100, which he would again exchange in the above proportions, beginning the process again and again. But he would also work 3 hours less; i.e. he would save 25% surplus labour = 25% surplus value out of the exchange which he undertakes between 40 thalers in subsistence and his labour time; and if at some time he worked 3 hours extra, because the material and the instrument were there on hand, then it would not occur to him to say that he had created a new value of 10%, but rather one of 25%, because he could buy one fourth additional subsistence, 50 thalers' worth instead of 40; and, since he is concerned with use values, these items of subsistence by themselves would be of value for him. This illusion that the new value is derived not from the exchange of 9 hours of labour time as objectified in 40 thalers for 12 hours of living labour, i.e. a surplus value of 25% on this part, but that it comes from an even 10% increase in the total capital -- 10% of 60 is 6 and of 40 is 4 -- this illusion is the basis of the notorious Dr Price's *compound interest calculation*,[^2] which led the heaven-born Pitt to his *sinking fund* idiocy.[^3] The identity of surplus gain with surplus labour time -- absolute and relative -- sets a qualitative limit on the accumulation of capital, namely the *working day*, the amount of time out of 24 hours during which labouring capacity can be active, the degree to which the productive forces are developed, and the population, which expresses the number of simultaneous working days etc. If, on the other side, surplus value is defined merely as interest -- i.e. as the relation in which capital increases itself by means of some imaginary sleight of hand, then the limit is merely quantitative, and there is then absolutely no reason why capital cannot every other day convert the interest into capital and thus yield interest on its interest in infinite geometrical progression. Practice has shown the economists that Price's interest-multiplication is impossible; but they have never discovered the blunder contained in it.[]{#p376}

Of the 110 thalers which emerge at the end of production, 60 thalers (material and instrument), in so far as they are values, have remained absolutely unchanged. The worker took nothing away from them and added nothing to them. Of course, from the standpoint of the capitalist, the fact that the worker maintains the value of objectified labour by the very fact of his labour being living labour appears as if the worker still had to pay the capitalist to get permission to enter into the proper relation with the objectified moments, the objective conditions, of labour. Now, as regards the remaining 50 thalers, 40 of them represent not only preservation but *actual reproduction*, since capital has divested itself of them \[*von sich entÃ¤ussert*\] in the form of wages and the worker has consumed them; 10 thalers represent production above and beyond reproduction, i.e. 1/4 surplus labour (of 3 hours). Only these 50 thalers are a product of the production process. Therefore, if the worker, as is wrongly asserted, divided the product with the capitalist so that the former's share were 9/10, then he would have to get not 40 thalers (and he has obtained them in advance, in exchange for which he has reproduced them and paid them back in their entirety, as well as maintaining the already existing values for the capitalist free of charge), which is only 8/10 but rather 45, which would leave capital only 5. Then, having begun the production process with 100 thalers, the capitalist would have at the end only 65 thalers as product. But the worker obtains none of the 40 thalers he has reproduced, nor any of the 10 thalers of surplus value. If the 40 thalers which have been reproduced are to serve for the purchase of further living labour, then, as far as the relation is concerned, all that can be said is that an objectified labour of 9 hours (40 thalers) buys living labour for 12 hours (50 thalers) and thus yields a surplus value of 25% of the real product (partly reproduced as wage fund, partly newly produced as surplus value) in the realization process.

Just now the original capital of 100 was: 50 -- 10 -- 40.[^4] Produced surplus gain of 10 thalers (25% surplus time). *Altogether* 110 thalers.

Now suppose it were: 60 -- 20 -- 20. The result would be 110 thalers, so says the ordinary economist, and the even more ordinary capitalist says that 10% has been produced in equal proportions by all parts of the capital. Again, 80 thalers of capital would merely be preserved; no change taken place in its value. Only the[]{#p377} 20 thalers would have turned into 30; i.e. surplus labour would have increased by 50%, not by 25% as before.

Take the third case: 100: 70 -- 20 -- 10. Result 110.

Then the invariable value, 90. The new product 20; hence surplus value or surplus time 100%. Here we have three cases in which the profit on the whole capital is always 10, but in the first case the new value created was 25% above the objectified labour spent to buy living labour, in the second case 50%, in the third: 100%.\>

The devil take this wrong arithmetic.[^5] But never mind. *CommenÃ§ons de nouveau.*

In the first case we had:

  Invariable value   Wage labour   Surplus value   Total
  ------------------ ------------- --------------- -------
  60                 40            10              110

We continue to presuppose a working day = 12 hours. (We could also assume a growing working day, e.g. *x* hours before, but now *x* + *b* hours, while productive force remains constant; or both factors variable.)

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------- ----------------- ----------------- --------------------------
  If the worker produces in   12                50                Â 

  then in                     1                 4 1/6             Â 

  then in                     9 3/5             40                \
                                                                  } in 12 hours 50 thalers

  then in                     2 2/5             10                
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The worker's necessary labour then amounts to 9 3/5 hours (40 thalers); hence surplus labour 2 2/5 hours (value of 10 thalers). 2 2/5 hours is 1/5 of the working day. The worker's surplus labour amounts to 1/5 of the day, i.e. = the value of 10 thalers. Now if we look at these 2 2/5 hours as a percentage which capital has gained above the labour time objectified in 9 3/5 hours, then 2 2/5:9 3/5 = 12/5:48/5, i.e. = 12:48 = 1:4. Thus 1/4 of the capital = 25% of it. Likewise, 10 thalers : 40 thalers = 1:4 = 25%. Now, summarizing the whole result:[^6][]{#p378}

  No.Â I   Original capital:   Constant value:   Value reproduced for wages:   Surplus value from production:   Total sum:   Surplus time and value:                \% of objectified labour exchanged:
  ------- ------------------- ----------------- ----------------------------- -------------------------------- ------------ -------------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  Â        100                 60                40                            10                               110          2 2/5 hours or 10. (2 2/5 of labour)   25%

(It might be said that the *instrument of labour*, its value, has to be not only replaced but reproduced; since it is in fact used up, consumed in production. This to be looked at under *fixed capital*. In actuality the value of the instrument is transposed to that of the material; to the extent that it is objectified labour, it only changes its form. If in the above example the value of the material was 50 and that of the instrument 10, then now, with the instrument used up by 5, the value of the material is 55 and that of the instrument 5; if it disappears altogether, then that of the material has reached 60. This is an element of the simple production process. Unlike wages, the instrument has not been consumed *outside the production process.*)

Now to the second presupposition:

Original capital:

Constant Value:

Value reproduced for wages:

Surplus value from production:

Total sum:

100

80

20

10

110

If the worker produces 30 thalers in 12 hours, then in 1 hour 2 2/4 thalers, in 8 hours 20 thalers, in 4 hours 10 thalers. 10 thalers are 50% of 20 thalers; as are 4 hours out of 8 hours; the surplus value = 4 hours, 1/3 of a day, or 10 thalers surplus value.

Thus:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  No.Â II   Original capital   Constant value:   Value reproduced for wages:   Surplus value from production:   Total sum:   Surplus time and value:   \% on capital:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#p379}

In the first case, like the second, the profit on a total capital of 100 = 10%, but in the first case the real surplus value which capital obtains from the production process is 25%, in the second, 50%.

The conditions presupposed in No. II are in themselves as possible as those in No. I. But brought into connection with one another, those of No. II are absurd. Material and instrument have been raised from 60 to 80, the productivity of labour has fallen from 4 1/6 thalers per hour to 2 3/4 and surplus value increased by 100%. (Suppose, however, that the increased expenditure for wages expresses more working days in the first case, fewer in the second, and then the presupposition is correct.) It is in itself irrelevant that necessary wages, i.e. the value of labour expressed in thalers, have fallen. Whether the value of an hour of labour is expressed in 2 thalers or in 4, in both cases the product of 12 hours of labour is exchanged (in circulation) for 12 hours of labour, and in both cases surplus labour appears as surplus value. The absurdity of the presupposition comes from the fact (1) that we have posited 12 hours as the minimum working time; and hence cannot introduce additional or fewer working days; (2) the more we make capital increase on one side, the more we not only make *necessary* labour decline, but have also to decrease its *value*, although the value is the same. In the second case, the price would, rather, have to rise. The fact that the worker can live from less work, i.e. that he produces more in the same number of hours, would have to be shown not in a decrease in the thalers for necessary labour, but in the number of necessary hours. If he gets, as e.g. in the first case, 4 1/6 thalers, but if the use value of this value, which has to be *constant* in order to express *value* (not price), had multiplied, then he no longer needs 9 3/5 but only 4 hours for the reproduction of his living labouring capacity, and this would have to express itself in the surplus over the value. But the way we have set up the presuppositions, our 'invariable value' is variable, while the 10% are invariable, here a constant addition to reproductive labour, although it expresses different percentage parts of the same. In the first case the invariable value is smaller than in the second case, but the total product of labour is larger; since, if one part of 100 is smaller, the other has to be larger; and, since absolute labour time is fixed at the identical amount, and since further the total product of labour becomes smaller, in proportion as 'invariable value' becomes larger, and larger as the latter becomes smaller, we therefore obtain[]{#p380} less product (absolutely) from the same labour time in proportion as more capital is employed. Now, this would be quite correct, since, if out of a given sum such as 100 more is spent as 'invariable value', less can be spent for labour time, and thus, *relative* to total capital, less new overall value can be created; but then, if capital is to make a profit, one cannot hold *labour time* constant, as is done here, or, if one holds it constant, the *value of the working hour* cannot become smaller, as it does here; which is impossible if 'invariable value' becomes larger and *surplus value* becomes *larger*; the *number of* working hours would have to become smaller. But that is what we have assumed in the example. We assume in the first case that 50 thalers are produced in 12 hours of labour; in the second case, only 30 thalers. In the first, we make the worker work 9 3/5 hours; in the second only 6, although he produces less per hour. It's absurd. But, understood differently, is there not after all something correct in these figures? Does not absolute new value decrease despite an increase in the relative, as soon as relatively more material and instrument than labour is introduced into the component parts of capital? Relative to a given capital, less living labour is employed; hence, even if the excess of this living labour above its costs is greater, and therefore the percentage of wages rises, i.e. the percentage relative to capital actually consumed, then the absolute new value does not necessarily become relatively smaller than in the case of a capital which employs less material and instrument (and this is the main point of the change in invariable value, i.e. value unchanged as value in the production process) and relatively more living labour; precisely because relatively more living labour is employed? An increase in the productive force then corresponds to the increase in the instrument, since the surplus value of the instrument does not keep pace, as in the previous mode of production, with its use value, its productive force, and since any increase in productive force creates more surplus value, although by no means in the same numerical proportion. The increase in the productive forces, which has to express itself in an enlargement of the value of the instrument -- the space it takes up in capital expenditure -- necessarily brings with it an increase in the material, since more material has to be worked in order to produce more product. (The increase in the productive force can, however, also relate to quality; but if that is given, only to quantity; or to quantity if quality is given; or to both.) Now, although there is less (necessary) labour in relation to surplus[]{#p381} labour, and absolutely less living labour in relation to capital, is it not possible for its surplus value to rise, although in relation to the capital as a whole it declines, i.e. the so-called rate of profit declines? Take for example a capital of 100. Let material be 30 at first. 30 for instrument. (Together, invariable value of 60.) Wages 40 (4 working days). Profit 10%. Here profit is 25% on wages and 10% on capital as a whole. Now let material become 40 and instrument 40. Let productivity double, so that only 2 working days necessary = 20. Now posit that the absolute profit be smaller than 10; i.e. the profit on total capital. Is it not possible for profit on labour employed to be more than 25%, i.e. in the given case, more than merely a fourth of 20? In fact, a third of 20 is 6 2/3; i.e. less than 10, but 33 1/3% of labour employed, while in the previous case it was only 25%. In this case, we would end up with only 106 2/3, while in the previous case we would have had 110, but still, with the same capital (100) the surplus labour, surplus gain relative to labour employed, would be greater than in the first case; but since 50% less labour was employed, in absolute terms, than in the first case, while the profit on labour employed was only 8 1/3 more than in the first case, it follows that the absolute quantity which results has to be smaller, and the same applies to the profit on total capital. For 20 Ã 33 1/3 is smaller than 40 Ã 25. This whole instance is improbable and cannot count as a general example in economics; for an increase in the instrument and an increase in the material worked are both presupposed, while not only the relative but the absolute number of workers has declined. (Of course, when two factors = a third, one has to grow smaller as the other grows larger.) But an increase in the value of the instrument in relation to capital as a whole, and an increase in the value of the material, all in all presuppose a division of labour, hence at least an absolute increase in the number of workers, if not an increase relative to capital as a whole. However, take the case of the lithographing machine, which everyone can use to make lithographs without special skill; suppose the value of the instrument immediately upon its invention to be greater than that which 4 workers absorbed before these handy things were invented; it now requires only 2 workers (here, as with many instrument-like machines, no further division of labour takes place; instead, the qualitative division disappears); let the instruments originally have a value of only 40, but let 4 working days be necessary (necessary, here, for the capitalist to make a profit). (There are machines, e.g.[]{#p382} forced air heating ducts, where labour as such disappears altogether except at a single point; the duct is open at one point, and carries heat to the others; no workers are required at all. This the case generally (see Babbage)[^7] with energy transmission, where, previously, energy had to be carried in material form by numbers of workers, here firemen, from one point to another -- where the transmission from one room to another, which has now become a physical process, appeared as the labour of numbers of workers.) Now, if he uses this lithographing machine as a source of income, as capital, and not as use value, then the material must necessarily increase, since he can put out more lithographs in the same amount of time, which is precisely where this greater profit comes from. Let this lithographer then employ an instrument to the amount of 40, material 40, 2 working days (20) which \[give\] him 33 1/3%, i.e. 6 2/3 out of an objectified labour time of 20; then his capital, like the other's, consists of 100, only yields 6 2/3%, but he gains 33 1/3 on labour employed, while the other gains 10 on capital, but only 25% on labour. The value obtained from labour employed may be smaller, but the profits on the whole capital are greater if the other elements of capital are relatively smaller. Despite this, the business at 6 2/3% on the total capital and 33 1/3% on labour could become more profitable than the earlier one based on 25% on labour and 10% profit on the total capital. Suppose e.g. that grain prices etc. rose so that the maintenance of the worker rose by 25% in value. The 4 working days would now cost the first lithographer 50 instead of 40. His instruments and material would remain the same: 60 thalers. He would then have to lay out a capital of 110. With this capital, his profit on the 50 thalers for 4 working days would be 12 (25%). Hence 12 thalers on 110 (i.e. 9 1/6% on the total capital of 110). The other lithographer: machine 40, material 40; but the 2 working days will cost him 25% more than 20, i.e. 25. He would thus have to lay out 105; his surplus value on labour 33 1/3%, i.e. 1/3, is 8 1/3. He would gain then, 8 1/3 on 105; 13 1/8%. Then suppose a 10 year cycle with 5 bad and 5 good harvests at the above average proportions; then the first lithographer would gain 50 thalers of interest on the second during the first 5 years; in the last 5 45 5/6; altogether 95 5/6 thalers; average interest over the 10 years 9 7/12 thalers. The other capitalist would have gained 31 1/3 in the first 5 years, 65 5/8 in the last; 96 23/24 altogether; a 10-year average of 9 84/120. Since No. II uses up more material at the same price, he sells[]{#p383} cheaper. It could be said in reply that he sells dearer because he uses up more instrument; especially because he uses up more of the value of the machine in proportion as he uses up more material; however, it is in practice not true that machines wear out and have to be replaced more rapidly as they work more material. But all this is beside the point. Let the relation between the value of the machine and that of the material be constant in both cases.

This example attains significance only if we assume a smaller capital which employs more labour and less material and machinery, but yields a higher percentage on the total capital; and a larger capital employing more machinery and more material, as many working days in absolute numbers but relatively fewer, and a smaller percentage on the whole, because less on labour, being more productive, division of labour used, etc. It also has to be postulated (which was not done above) that the use value of the machine significantly greater than its value; i.e. that its devaluation in the service of production is not proportional to its increasing effect on production.

Thus, as above, a press (first, hand-operated printing press; second, self-acting printing press).

*Capital I*, 100, uses 30 in material; 30 for the manual press; 4 working days = 40 thalers; gain 10%; hence 25% on living labour (1/4 surplus time).

*Capital II*, 200, uses 100 in materials; 60 in press, 4 working days (40 thalers); gain on the 4 working days 13 1/3 thalers = 1 working day and 1/3, compared to only 1 working day in the first case; total sum: 213 1/3. I.e. 6 2/3%, compared to 10% in the first case. Nevertheless, the surplus value on the labour which has been employed is 13 1/3 in this second case, as against 10 in the first; in the first, 4 days create 1 surplus day in 4 working days; in the second, 4 days create 1 1/3 surplus days. But the rate of profit on the total capital is 1/3 or 33 1/3% smaller than in the first; the total amount of the gain is 1/3 greater. Now let us suppose that the 30 and the 100 in material are sheets of book paper, and that the instruments wear out in the same space of time, say 10 years or 1/10 per year. Then No. I has to replace 1/10 of 30 in material, i.e. 3; No. II, 1/10 of 60, i.e. 6. The material does not enter further into annual production (which may be regarded as 4 working days of 3 months each) on either side, see above.

*Capital I* sells 30 sheets at 30 for materials + 3 for instrument + 50 (objectified labour time) (production time) = 83.[]{#p384}

*Capital II* sells 100 sheets at 100, material, + 6, instrument, + 53 1/3 = 159 1/3.

*Capital I* sells 30 sheets for 83 thalers, 1 sheet at 83/80 thalers = 2 thalers, 23 silver groschen.

*Capital II* sells 100 sheets for 159 thalers, 10 silver groschen; 1 sheet at

  -------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  159 thalers 10 silver groschen   i.e., 1 thaler, 17 silver groschen, 8 pfennigs.
  100                              Â 
  -------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------

It is clear then that Capital I is done for, because its selling price is infinitely too high. Now, although in the first case the profit on total capital was 10% and in the second case only 6 2/3%, the first capital only took in 25% on labour time, while the second takes 33 1/3%. With Capital I, necessary labour is greater relative to the total capital; and hence surplus labour, while smaller in absolute terms than with Capital II, shows up as a higher rate of profit on the smaller total capital. 4 working days at 60 are greater than 4 at 160; in the first, 1 working day corresponds to a capital of 15; in the second, 1 working day corresponds to 40. But with the second capital, labour is more productive (which is given both in the *greater* amount of machinery, hence the greater amount of space that it takes up among the value components of capital; and in the greater amount of material in which a working day, which consists of a greater proportion of surplus time and hence uses more material in the same time, is expressed). It creates more surplus time (relative surplus time, i.e. determined by the development of the force of production). In the first case, surplus time is 1/4, in the second, 1/3. It therefore creates more use values and a higher exchange value in the same amount of time; but the latter not in proportion with the former, since, as we saw, exchange value does not rise in the same numerical proportion as the productivity of labour. The fractional price is therefore smaller than the total production price -- i.e. the fractional price multiplied by the amount of fractional prices produced is greater. Now, if we had assumed an *absolutely greater* number of working days than in No. I, although a relatively smaller number, then the matter would have been even more striking. The profit of the larger capital, working with more machinery, therefore appears smaller than that of the smaller capital working with relatively or absolutely more living labour, precisely because the *higher profit on living labour* appears as smaller, when calculated on the basis of a total capital in which living labour makes up a lesser proportion[]{#p385} of the whole, than the *lower profit on living labour* which makes up a larger proportion of the smaller total capital. But the fact that No. II can employ more material, and that a larger proportion of the total value is in the instrument, is only the expression of the productivity of labour.

This, then, is the unfortunate Bastiat's famous riddle; he had firmly convinced himself -- to which Mr Proudhon had no answer -- that because the rate of profit of the larger and more productive total capital is smaller, it follows that the worker's share has grown larger, whereas precisely the *opposite* is the case; his surplus labour has grown larger.[^8]

Nor does Ricardo seem to have understood the matter, for otherwise he would not have tried to explain the periodic decline of profit merely by the rise in wages caused by the rise in grain prices (and hence of rent).[^9] But at bottom, surplus value -- in so far as it is indeed the foundation of profit, but still distinct from profit commonly so-called -- has never been developed. The unfortunate Bastiat would have said in the above case that in the first example the profit was 10% (i.e. 1/10), in the second only 6 1/4%, i.e. 1/16 (leaving out the percentage), so that the worker receives 9/10 in the first case, 15/16 in the second. The relation is correct in neither of the two cases, nor is their relation to one another correct. Now, as far as the further relation of the new value of capital to capital as *indifferent total value* is concerned (and this is how capital as such appeared to us at the beginning, before we moved on into the production process, and it must again appear to us in this way at the end of the process), this is to be developed partly under the rubric of *profit*, where the new value obtains a new character, and partly under the heading of *accumulation*. We are here initially concerned only with developing the nature of surplus value as the equivalent of the absolute or relative labour time mobilized by capital above and beyond necessary labour time.

The consumption, in the production process, of the element of value consisting of the instrument cannot in the least \[serve to\] distinguish the instrument of labour from the material -- here, where all that is to be explained is the creation of surplus value, self realization. This is because this consumption is part of the simple production process itself, hence the value of the consumed instrument (whether it be the *simple use value* of the instrument itself[]{#p386} or the exchange value, if production has already progressed to where there is a division of labour and where at least the surplus is exchanged) has to be recovered again in the value (exchange value) or the use value of the product -- so that the process can begin anew. The instrument loses its use value in the same proportion as it helps to raise the exchange value of the raw material and serves as a means of labour. This point must, indeed, be examined, because the distinction between the invariable value, the part of capital which is preserved; that which is reproduced (*reproduced* for capital; from the standpoint of the real production of labour -- *produced*); and that which is newly produced, is of essential importance.

##### *Multiplication of simultaneous working days.* (Accumulation of capital.) -- *Growth of the constant part of capital in relation to the variable part spent on wages = growth of the productivity of labour. -- Proportion in which capital has to increase in order to employ the same number of workers if productivity rises*

It is now time to finish with the question of the value resulting from the growth of the productive forces. We have seen: this creates a *surplus value* (not merely a greater use value) just as in the case of an absolute increase in surplus labour. If a certain limit is given, say e.g. that the worker needs only half a day in order to produce his subsistence for a *whole* day -- and if the natural limit has been reached -- then an increase of absolute labour time is possible only if more workers are employed *at the same time*, so that the real working day is simultaneously multiplied instead of only lengthened (in the given conditions, the individual worker can work no more than 12 hours; if a surplus time of 24 hours is to be gained, then there have to be 2 workers). Capital in this case, before entering the self-realization process, has to buy 6 additional hours of labour in the act of exchange with the worker, i.e. has to lay out a greater part of itself; at the same time it has to lay out more for material, on the average (beside the fact that the extra worker has to be *available*, i.e. that the working population has to have grown). Hence the possibility of this further realization process depends here on a previous accumulation of capital (as regards its material existence). If, however, productivity increases, and hence relative surplus time -- at the present point we can still regard capital as always directly engaged in the production of[]{#p387} subsistence, raw materials etc. -- then less expenditure is necessary for wages and the growth in the material is created by the realization process itself. But this question belongs, rather, with the *accumulation* of capitals.

We now come to the point where we last broke off.[^10] An increase in productivity increases the *surplus value*, although it does not increase the absolute amount of exchange values. It increases values because it creates a new *value as value*, i.e. a value which is not merely an equivalent destined for exchange, but which asserts itself as such; in a word, more money. The question is: does it ultimately also increase the amount of exchange values? This is, at bottom, admitted; for even Ricardo admits that along with the accumulation of capitals there is an increase in savings, hence a growth in the exchange values produced. The growth of savings means nothing more than the growth of independent values -- of money. But Ricardo's demonstration contradicts his own assertion.

Our old example. 100 thalers capital; 60 thalers in constant value; 40 in wages; produces 80; hence product = 140. [\*](#pagenote387){#pagenoter387} Let these 40 in surplus value be absolute labour time.

[\*](#pagenoter387){#pagenote387} Here we see again that the surplus value on the whole of the capital = to half of the newly produced value, since a half of the latter = to necessary labour. The relation between this surplus value, which is always equal to surplus time, i.e. = to the worker's total product minus the part which forms his wage, depends (1) on the relation between the constant part of capital and the productive part; (2) between necessary labour time and surplus time. In the above case, the relation of surplus time to necessary time is 100%; gives 40% on a capital of 100; hence (3) it depends further, not only on the relation given above in (2), but also on the absolute magnitude of necessary labour. If, in a capital of 100, the constant part were 80, then the part exchanged for necessary labour would be = 20, and if this created 100% surplus time, the profit on capital would be 20%. But if the capital were 200 with the same relation between the constant and the variable part (i.e. 3/5 to 2/5), then the total would be 280, which is 40 out of 100. In this case the absolute amount of profit would rise from 40 to 80, but the relation would remain at 40%. However, if out of the 200 the constant element were 120 and the quantity of necessary labour 80, but the latter increased by only 10%, i.e. 8, then the total sum would be = 208, i.e. a profit of 4%; if it increased by only 5, then the total 205, i.e. 2 1/2%.

Now suppose that productivity doubles: then, if a wage of 40 gives 8 hours of necessary labour, the worker could now produce a whole day of living labour in 4 hours. Surplus time would then []{#p388} increase by 1/3 (2/3 of a day to produce a whole day before, now 1/3). 2/3 of the product of the working day would be surplus value, and if the hour of necessary labour = 5 thalers (5 Ã 8 = 40), then he would now need only 5 Ã 4 = 20 thalers. For capital, then, a surplus gain of 20, i.e. 60 instead of 40. At the end, 140, of which 60 = the constant value, 20 = the wage and 60 = the surplus gain; together, 140. The capitalist can then begin production anew with 80 thalers of capital:

Let capitalist A on the same stage of old production invest his capital of 140 in new production. Following the original proportions, he needs 3/5 for the invariable part of capital, i.e. 3 Ã 140/5 = 3 Ã 28 = 84, leaving 56 for necessary labour. Before, he spent 40 on labour, now 56; 2/5 of 40 additionally. Then at the end, his capital = 84 + 56 + 56 = 196.

Capitalist B on the higher stage of production would similarly employ his 140 thalers for new production. If out of a capital of 80 he needs 60 for invariable value and only 20 for labour, then out of a capital of 60 he needs 45 for invariable value and 15 for labour; thus the total would be = 60 + 20 +20 = 100 in the first and, secondly, 45 + 15 + 15 = 75. Thus his total yield is 175, while that of the first = 196. An increase in the productivity of labour means nothing more than that the same capital creates the same value with less labour, or that less labour creates the same product with more capital. That less necessary labour produces more surplus labour. The necessary labour is smaller in relation to capital; for the process of its realization this is obviously the same as: capital is larger in relation to the necessary labour which it sets into motion; for the same capital sets more surplus labour in motion, hence less necessary labour. [\*](#pagenote388){#pagenoter388} []{#p389}

[\*](#pagenoter388){#pagenote388} If it is postulated, as in our case, that the capital remains the same, i.e. that both begin again with 140 thalers, then in the case of the more productive capital, a larger part has to go to capital (i.e. to its invariable part), while with the less productive capital, a larger part to labour. The first capital of 140 thus sets into motion a necessary labour of 56, and this necessary labour presupposes an invariable part of 84 out of the total capital. The second sets labour in the amount of 20 + 15 = 35 into motion, and an invariable capital of 60 + 45 = 105 (it further follows from what was developed earlier that an increase in the force of production does not proportionately increase value). In the first case, as already shown above, the absolute new value is greater than in the second, because the mass of labour employed is greater in relation to the invariable part; while in the second the former is smaller, precisely because labour is more productive. However (1) the difference between the new value of 60 in one case and 40 in the other means that the first cannot begin production anew with the same capital as the second; for a part of the new value on both sides has to enter into circulation as an equivalent so that the capitalist can live, and live from his capital. If both of them eat up 20 thalers then the first begins anew with a capital of 120, the other also with 120 etc. See above. Return to this whole matter again;[^11] but the question of the relation between the new value created by the increased force of production and the new value created by absolute increases in labour belongs in the chapter on *accumulation and profit*.

It is sometimes said about machinery, therefore, that it *saves labour*; however, as Lauderdale correctly remarked, the mere saving of labour is not the characteristic thing;[^12] for, with the help of machinery, human labour performs actions and creates things which without it would be absolutely impossible of accomplishment. The latter concerns the use value of machinery. What is characteristic is the *saving* of necessary labour and the creating of *surplus labour.* The higher productivity of labour is expressed in the fact that capital has to buy a smaller amount of necessary labour in order to create the same value and a greater quantity of use values, or that less necessary labour creates the same exchange value, realizes more material and a greater mass of use values. Thus, *if the total value of the capital remains the same*, an increase in the productive force means that the constant part of capital (consisting of machinery and material) grows relative to the variable, i.e. to the part of capital which is exchanged for living labour and forms the wage fund. This means at the same time that a smaller quantity of labour sets a larger quantity of capital in motion. If the *total value of capital* entering into the production process increases, then the wage fund (this variable part of capital) must decrease *relatively*, compared to the relation if the productivity of labour, i.e. the relation of necessary to surplus labour, had remained the same. Now let us assume in the above case that the capital of 100 is agricultural capital. Then, 40 thalers for seeds, fertilizer etc.; 20 thalers instrument of labour, and 40 thalers wage labour, at the old level of production. (Let these 40 thalers = 4 days of necessary labour.) At the old production level, these create a total of 140. Now let fertility double, owing to improvement either in the instrument or in the fertilizer []{#p390} etc. In this case the product has to = 140 thalers (given that the instrument is entirely consumed). Let fertility double, so that the price of the necessary working day falls by half; so that only 4 necessary half days of work (i.e. 2 whole ones) are necessary in order to produce 8. 2 working days to produce 8 is the same as when 1/4 of each working day (3 hours) is required for necessary labour. Now, instead of 40 thalers, the farmer has to spend only 20 for labour. Thus at the end of the process the component parts of capital have changed; from the original 40 for seed etc., which now have double the use value; 20 for instrument and 20 for labour (2 whole working days). Before the relation of the constant part of capital to the variable = 60:40 = 3:2; now 80:20 = 4:1. Looking at the whole capital, necessary labour was = 2/5; now 1/5. Now, if the farmer wants to continue to use labour in the old relation, then by how much would his capital have to increase? Or -- in order to avoid the *nefarious presupposition* that he continued to operate with a constant capital of 60 and a wage fund of 40 -- after a doubling of productive force, which introduces false relations; [\*](#pagenote390){#pagenoter390} because it presupposes that, despite the doubled force of production, capital continued to operate with the same component parts, to employ the same quantity of necessary labour without spending more for raw material and instrument of labour; [â ](#pagenote390_2){#pagenoter390_2} then, therefore, productivity doubles, so that he now needs to spend only 20 thalers on labour, whereas he needed 40 before. (If it is given that 4 whole working days were necessary, each = 10 thalers, in order to create a surplus of 4 whole working days, and if this surplus is provided for him by the transformation of 40 thalers of cotton into yarn, then he now needs only 2 whole working days in order to create the same value, i.e. that of 8 working days; the value of the yarn expressed a surplus time of 4 working days before, now of 6. Or, each of the workers needed 6 hours of necessary labour time before in order to create 12; now 3. Necessary labour time was 12 Ã 4 = 48, or 4 days. In each of these days, the surplus time was = 1/2 day (6 hours). It []{#p391} now amounts to only 12 Ã 2 = 24 or 2 days; 3 hours per day. In order to bring forth the surplus value, each of the 4 workers would have to work 6 Ã 2 hours; i.e. 1 day; now he needs to work only 3 Ã 2 hours; i.e. 1/2 day. Now, whether 4 work 1/2 a day or 2 a whole (1) day is the same. The capitalist could dismiss 2 workers. He would even have to dismiss them, since a certain quantity of cotton is only enough to make a certain quantity of yarn; thus he cannot order 4 whole days of work any more, but only 4 half days. But if the worker has to work 12 hours in order to obtain 3 hours, i.e. his *necessary* wage, then, if he works 6 hours, he will obtain only 1 1/2 hours of exchange value. But if he can live for 12 hours with 3 hours of necessary labour, then with it he can live only 6 hours. Thus if all 4 workers were to be employed, each of the 4 could live only half a day; i.e. the same capital cannot keep all 4 alive as *workers*, but only 2. The capitalist could pay 4 out of the old fund for 4 half days of work; then he would pay 2 too many and would make the workers a present of the productive force; since he can use only 4 half days of living labour; such 'possibilities' neither occur in practice, nor can we deal with them here, where we are concerned with the relation of capital as such.) Now 20 thalers of the capital of 100 are not directly employed in production. The capitalist uses 40 thalers of raw material, 20 for instrument, together 60 as before, but now only 20 thalers for labour (2 working days). Of the whole capital of 80 he uses 3/4 (60) for the constant part and only 1/4 for labour. Then if he employs the remaining 20 in the same way, 3/4 for constant capital, 1/4 for labour; then 15 for the first, 5 for the second. Now since 1 working day = 10 thalers (given), 5 would be only = 6 hours = 1/2 working day. With the new value of 20, gained through productivity, capital could buy only 1/2 a working day more, if it continues to realize itself in the same proportion. It would have to grow threefold (namely, 60) (together with the 20 = 80) in order to employ the 2 dismissed workers for the previous 2 full working days. In the new relation, the capital uses 3/4 in constant capital in order to employ 1/4 as wage fund.

[\*](#pagenoter390){#pagenote390} Although in the case e.g. of the farmer this is quite correct, if the seasons bring a doubling of fertility, and correct for every industrialist if the force of production doubles not in his branch, but in the branch whose output he uses; i.e. if e.g. raw cotton cost 50% less and grain (i.e. wages) and the instrument likewise; he would then continue as before to spend 40 thalers for raw cotton, but in twice the quantity, 20 for machinery, 40 for labour.

[â ](#pagenoter390_2){#pagenote390_2} Suppose cotton alone doubled in productivity, the machine remains the same, then -- this to be examined further.

Thus if 20 is the whole capital, 3/4 i.e. 15 constant and 1/4 labour (i.e. 5) = 1/2 a working day.

With a whole capital of 4 Ã 20, hence 4 Ã 15 = 60 constant, hence 4 Ã 5 = 20 wages = 4/2 working days = 2 working days.

Therefore, if the productive force of labour doubles, so that a capital of 60 thalers in raw materials and instrument now needs []{#p392}only 20 thalers in labour (2 working days) for its realization, whereas it needed 100 before, then the total capital of 100 would have to grow to 160, or the capital of 80 now being dealt with would have to double in order to retain all the labour put out of work. But the doubling of productive force creates a new capital of only 20 thalers = 1/2 of the labour time employed earlier; and this is only enough to employ 1/2 a working day additionally. Before the doubling of the productive force, the capital was 100 and employed 4 working days (on the supposition that 2/5 = wage fund of 40); now, when the wage fund has fallen to 1/5 of 100, to 20 = 2 working days (but to 1/4 of 80, the capital newly entering into the realization process), it would have to rise to 160, by 60%, in order still to be able to employ 4 working days as before. It can only employ 1/2 a new working day with the 20 thalers drawn from the increase in the productive force, if the whole old capital continues operating. Before, it employed with 100, 16/4 (4 days) working days; it could now employ only 5/4. Therefore, when the force of production doubles, capital does not need to double in order to set the same necessary labour into motion, 4 working days; i.e. it does not need to rise to 200, but needs to rise only by double the whole, minus the part deducted from the wage fund. (100 â 20 = 80) Ã 2 = 160. (By contrast, the first capital, before the increase in productive force, which divided 100 as 60 constant 40 wages (4 working days), in order to employ two additional days, would need to grow from 100 to only 150; i.e. 3/5 constant capital (30) and 2/5 wage fund (20). If it is given that the working day doubles in both cases, then the second would amount to 250 at the end, the first only 160.) Of the part of capital which is withdrawn from the wage fund owing to the increase in the force of production, one part has to be transformed again into raw material and instrument, another part is exchanged for living labour; this can take place only in the proportions between the different parts which are posited by the new productivity. It can no longer take place in the old proportion, for the relation of the wage fund to the constant fund has decreased. If the capital of 100 first used 2/5 for wage fund (40) and, owing to a doubling of productive force, then used only 1/5 (20), then 1/5 of the capital has become free (20 thalers); and the employed part, 80, uses only 1/4 as wage fund. Thus, of the 20, similarly, only 5 thalers (1/2 working day). The whole capital of 100 therefore now employs 2 1/2 working days; or, it would have to grow to 160 in order to employ 4 again.

[]{#p393}If the original capital had been 1,000, divided in the same way: 3/5 constant capital, 2/5 wage fund, then 600 + 400 (let 400 equal 40 working days; each working day = 10 thalers). Now double the productive force of labour, i.e. only 20 working days required for the same product (= 200 thalers), then the capital necessary to begin production anew would be = 800; that is 600 + 200; 200 thalers would have been set free. Employed in the same relation, then 3/4 for constant capital = 150 and 1/4 wages = 50. Thus, if the 1,000 thalers are employed in their entirety, then now 750 constant + 250 wage fund = 1,000 thalers. But 250 wage fund would be = 25 working days (i.e. the new fund can employ labour time only in the new relation, i.e. at 1/4; in order to employ the entire labour time as before, it would have to *quadruple*). The liberated capital of 200 would employ a wage fund of 50 = 5 working days (1/4 of the liberated labour time). (The part of the labour fund disconnected from capital is itself employed as capital at only 1/4 for labour fund; i.e. precisely in the relation in which that part of the new capital which is labour fund stands to the total sum of the capital.) Thus in order to employ 20 working days (4 Ã 5 working days), this fund would have to grow from 50 to 4 Ã 50 = 200; i.e. the liberated part would have to grow from 200 to 600, i.e. triple; so that the entire new capital would amount to 800. Then the total capital, 1,600; of this, 1,200 constant part and 400 labour fund. Thus if a capital of 1,000 originally contained a labour fund of 400 (40 working days), and if, owing to a doubling of productive force, it now needs to employ a labour fund of only 200 in order to buy *necessary* labour, i.e. only 1/2 of the previous labour; then the capital would have to grow by 600 in order to employ all the previous labour in its entirety (in order to gain the same amount of surplus time). It would have to be able to employ twice the labour fund, i.e. 2 Ã 200 = 400; but, since the relation of the labour fund to the total capital is now = 1/4, this requires a total capital of 4 Ã 400 = 1,600. [\*](#pagenote393){#pagenoter393}

[\*](#pagenoter393){#pagenote393} The total capital which would be necessary in order to employ the old labour time is therefore = *to the old labour fund multiplied by the denominator* of the fraction which now expresses the relation of the labour fund to the new total capital. If the doubling of productive force has reduced the latter to 1/4, then multiplied by 4; if to 1/3, then multiplied by 3. If the productive force has doubled, then necessary labour, and thereby the labour fund, is reduced to 1/2 of its earlier value; but this makes up 1/4 relative to the new total capital of 800 or 1/5 relative to the old total capital of 1,000. *Or the new total capital is* = 2 Ã *the old capital minus the liberated part of the labour fund*; (1,000 â 200) Ã 2 = 800 Ã 2 = 1,600. The new total capital expresses the total sum of constant and variable capital required in order to employ half of the old labour time (1/3, 1/4, 1/*x*, etc, depending on whether the force of production increased 3 Ã, 4 Ã, *x* Ã ); 2 Ã then the capital required to employ all of it (or 3 Ã, 4 Ã, etc., depending on the relation in which the productive force has grown). The original relation of the parts of capital must here always be given (*technologically*); on this depends, e.g., in what ratios the multiplication of productive force expresses itself as a division of *necessary labour.*

[]{#p394}Or, which is the same thing, it is = 2 Ã *the new capital* which owing to the new productive force replaces the old in production (800 Ã 2) (thus if the productive force had quadrupled, quintupled etc. = 4 Ã, 5 Ã *the new capital* etc. If the force of production has doubled, then *necessary labour* is reduced to 1/2; likewise the labour fund. Thus if it amounted, as in the above case of the old capital of 1,000, to 400, i.e. 2/5 of the total capital, then, afterwards, 1/5 or 200. This relation, by which it is reduced, is the liberated part of the labour fund = 1/5 of the old capital = 200. 1/5 of the old = 1/4 of the new. The new capital is = to the old + 3/5 of the same. These trivia more closely later etc.)

Given the same original relations between the parts of the capital and the same increase in the productive force, the largeness or smallness of the capital is completely irrelevant for the general theses. Quite another question is whether, when capital grows *larger*, the relations remain the same (but this belongs under accumulation). But, given this, we see how an increase in the force of production changes the relations between the component parts of capital. If in both cases 3/5 was originally constant and 2/5 labour fund, then doubling the productive force acts in the same way on a capital of 100 as on one of 1,000. (The word *labour fund* is here used only for convenience's sake; we have not yet developed capital in this *specificity* \[*Bestimmtheit*\]. So far two parts; the one exchanged for commodities (material and instrument), the other for labour capacity.) (The *new capital*, i.e. the part of the old capital which represents its *function*, is = the old minus the liberated part of the labour fund; this liberated part, however, = the fraction which used to express necessary labour (or, same thing, the labour fund) divided by the multiplier of the productive force. Thus, if the old capital = 1,000 and the fraction expressing necessary labour or the labour fund = 2/5, and if the force of production[]{#p395} doubles, then the new capital which represents the function of the old = 800, i.e. 2/5 of the old capital = 400; this divided by 2, the multiplier of productive force, = 2/10 = 1/5 = 200. Then the new capital = 800 and the liberated part of the labour fund = 200.)

We have seen that under these conditions a capital of 100 thalers has to grow to 160, and a capital of 1,000 to 1,600, in order to retain the same labour time (of 4 or 40 working days) etc.; both have to grow by 60%, i.e. 3/5 of themselves (of the old capital), in order to be able to re-employ the liberated labour time (in the first case 20 thalers, in the second 200) of 1/5 -- the liberated labour fund -- as such.

We saw above that identical percentages of the total capital can express very different relations in which capital creates its surplus value, i.e. posits surplus labour, relative or absolute.[^13] If the relation between the invariable value-part of capital and the variable part (that exchanged for labour) such that the latter = 1/2 the total capital (i.e. capital 100 = 50 (constant) + 50 (variable), then the part exchanged for labour would have to increase by only 50% in order to yield 25% on the capital; i.e. 50 + 50 (+ 25) = 125; while in the above example 75 + 25 (+ 25) = 125; i.e. the part exchanged for living labour increases by 100% in order to yield 25% on the capital. Here we see that, if the relations remain the same, the same percentage on the total capital holds no matter how big or small it may be; i.e. if the relation of the labour fund to the total capital remains the same; thus, above, 1/4. Thus: 100 yields 125, 80 yields 100, 1,000 yields 1,250, 800 yields 1,000, 1,600 yields 2,000 etc., always = 25%. If capitals whose component parts are in different relations, including therefore their forces of production, nevertheless yield the same percentages on total capital, then the real surplus value has to be very different in the different branches.\>

\<Thus the example is correct, the productive force compared under the same conditions with the same capital *before* the rise in productive force. Let a capital of 100 employ constant value 50, labour fund = 50. Let the fund increase by 50%, i.e. 1/2; then the []{#p396}total product = 125. Let the labour fund of 50 thalers employ 10 working days, pay 5 thalers per day. Since the new value is 1/2, the surplus time has to be = 5 working days; i.e. the worker who needed to work only 10 working days in order to live for 15 has to work 15 for the capitalist in order to live for 15; and his surplus labour of 5 days constitutes capital's surplus value. Expressed in hours, if the work day = 12 hours, then surplus labour = 6 per day. Thus in 10 days or 120 hours, the worker works 60 hours = 5 days too many. But now with the doubling of productivity, relations within the 100 thalers would be 75 and 25, i.e. the same capital now needs to employ only 5 workers in order to create the same value of 125; the 5 working days then = 10; doubled; i.e. 5 working days are paid, 10 produced. The worker would need to work only 5 days in order to live 10 (before the increase in productive force he had to work 10 to live 15; thus, if he worked 5, he could live only 7 1/2); but he has to work 10 for the capitalist in order to live 10; the latter thus makes a profit of 5 days; 1 day per day; or, expressed in days, the worker had to work 1/2 to live 1 before (i.e. 6 hours to live 12); now he needs to work only 1/4 to live 1 (i.e. 3 hours). If he worked a whole day, he could live 2; if he worked 12 hours, 24; if he worked 6, 12 hours. But he now has to work 12 hours to live 12. He would need to work only 1/2 in order to live 1; but he has to work 2 Ã 1/2 = 1 to live 1. In the old state of the productive force, he had to work 10 days to live 15; or 12 hours to live 18; or 1 hour to live 1 1/2, or 8 hours to live 12, i.e. 2/3 of a day to live 3/3. But he has to work 3/3 to live 2/3, i.e. 1/3 too much. The doubling of the productive force increases the relation of surplus time from 1:1 1/2 (i.e. 50%) to 1:2 (i.e. 100%). In the earlier labour time relation: he needed 8 to live 12, i.e. 2/ 3 of the whole day was necessary labour; he now needs only 1/2, i.e. 6, to live 12. That is why capital now employs 5 workers instead of 10. If the 10 (cost 50) produced 75 before, then now the 25, 50: i.e. the former only 50%, the second 100. The workers work 12 hours as before; but in the first case capital bought 10 working days, now merely 5; because the force of production doubled, the 5 produce 5 days of surplus labour; because in the first case 10 working days yielded only 5 days of surplus labour; now, with the force of production doubled, i.e. risen from 50% to 100% -- 5, 5; in the first case 120 working hours (= 10 working days) produce 180; in the second, 60, 60; i.e. in the first case, the surplus time is 1/3 of the whole day (50% of[]{#p397} necessary labour) (i.e. 4 hours out of 12; necessary time 8); in the second case surplus time is 1/2 the whole day (100% of necessary labour) (i.e. 6 hours out of 12; necessary time 6); hence the 10 days yielded 5 days of surplus time (surplus labour) in the first case, and in the second the 5 yield 5. Thus relative surplus time has doubled; relative to the first relation it grew by only 1/2 compared to 1/3; i.e. by 16 4/6%.\>

Since surplus labour, or surplus time, is the presupposition of capital, it therefore also rests on the fundamental presupposition that there exists a surplus above the labour time necessary for the maintenance and reproduction of the individual; that the individual e.g. needs to work only 6 hours in order to live one day, or 1 day in order to live 2 etc. With the development of the forces of production, necessary labour time decreases and surplus labour time thereby increases. Or, as well, that one individual can work for 2 etc. ('*Wealth is disposable* time and nothing more. ... If the whole labour of a country were sufficient only to raise the support of the whole population, there would be no *surplus labour*, consequently nothing that can be allowed to accumulate as capital . . . Truly wealthy a nation, if there is *no interest* or if the working day is 6 hours rather than 12 ... Whatever may be *due* to the capitalist, he can only receive the *surplus labour* of the labourer; for the labourer must live.' (*The Source and Remedy of the National Difficulties.*)[^14]

'*Property*. Origin in the productivity of labour. If one can produce only enough for one, everyone worker; there can be no property. When one man's labour can maintain five, there will be four idle men for one employed in production. Property grows from the improvement in the mode of production ... The growth of the property, this greater ability to maintain idle men and unproductive industry = capital ... machinery itself can seldom be applied with success to abridge the labours of an individual: *more time would be lost in its construction than could be saved by*[]{#p398} *its application. It is only really useful when it acts on great masses, when a single machine can assist the labours of thousands.* It is accordingly in the most populous countries where there are most idle men that it is always most abundant. It is not called into action by scarcity of men, but by the facility with which they are brought together ... Not 1/4 of the English population provides everything that is consumed by all. Under William the Conqueror for example the amount of those directly participating in production much greater relative to the idle men.' (Ravenstone, IX, 32.)[^15]

Just as capital on one side creates surplus labour, surplus labour is at the same time equally the presupposition of the existence of capital. The whole development of wealth rests on the creation of disposable time. The relation of *necessary* labour time to the *superfluous* (such it is, initially, from the standpoint of necessary labour) changes with the different stages in the development of the productive forces. In the less productive[^16] stages of exchange, people exchange nothing more than their *superfluous labour time*; this is the measure of their exchange, which therefore extends only to superfluous products. In production resting on capital, the existence of *necessary* labour time is conditional on the creation of *superfluous* labour time. In the lowest stages of production, firstly, few human needs have yet been produced, and thus few to be satisfied. Necessary labour is therefore restricted, not because labour is productive, but because it is not very necessary; and secondly, in all stages of production there is a certain common quality \[*Gemeinsamkeit*\] of labour, *social* character of the same, etc. The force of social production develops later etc. (Return to this.)[^17]

##### *Increase of surplus labour time. Increase of simultaneous working days* (Population). *(Population can increase in proportion as* necessary labour time *becomes smaller, i.e. the time required to produce living labour capacities decreases.) -- Surplus capital and surplus population. -- Creation of free time for society*

*Surplus time* is the excess of the working day above that part of it which we call *necessary* labour time; it exists secondly as the []{#p399}multiplication of *simultaneous working days*, i.e. of the *labouring population.* (It can also be created -- but this is mentioned here only in passing, belongs in the chapter on wage labour -- by means of forcible prolongation of the working day beyond its natural limits; by the addition of women and children to the labouring population.) The first relation, that of the surplus time and the necessary time in the day, can be and is modified by the development of the productive forces, so that necessary labour is restricted to a constantly smaller fractional part. The same thing then holds relatively for the population. A labouring population of, say, 6 million can be regarded as one working day of 6 Ã 12, i.e. 72 million hours: so that the same laws applicable here.

It is a law of capital, as we saw, to create surplus labour, disposable time; it can do this only by setting *necessary labour* in motion -- i.e. entering into exchange with the worker. It is its tendency, therefore, to create as much labour as possible; just as it is equally its tendency to reduce necessary labour to a minimum. It is therefore equally a tendency of capital to increase the labouring population, as well as constantly to posit a part of it as surplus population -- population which is useless until such time as capital can utilize it. (Hence the correctness of the theory of surplus population and surplus capital.) It is equally a tendency of capital to make human labour (relatively) superfluous, so as to drive it, as human labour, towards infinity. Value is nothing but objectified labour, and surplus value (realization of capital) is only the excess above that part of objectified labour which is necessary for the reproduction of labouring capacity. But labour as such is and remains the presupposition, and surplus labour exists only in relation with the necessary, hence only in so far as the latter exists. Capital must therefore constantly posit necessary labour in order to posit surplus labour; it has to multiply it (namely the *simultaneous* working days) in order to multiply the surplus; but at the same time it must suspend them as necessary, in order to posit them as surplus labour. As regards the single working day, the process is of course simple: (1) to lengthen it up to the limits of natural possibility; (2) to shorten the necessary part of it more and more (i.e. to increase the productive forces without limit). But the working day, regarded spatially -- time itself regarded as space -- is *many working days alongside one another*. The more working days capital can enter into exchange with at once, during which it exchanges *objectified for living* []{#p400}*labour*, the greater its realization *at once*. It can leap over the *natural* limit formed by one individual's living, working day, *at a given stage in the development of the forces of production* (and it does not in itself change anything that this stage is changing) only by positing *another* working day alongside the *first* at the same time -- by the spatial addition *of more simultaneous working days*. E.g. I can drive the surplus labour of A no higher than 3 hours; but if I add the days of B, C, D etc., then it becomes 12 hours. In place of a surplus time of 3, I have created one of 12. This is why capital solicits the increase of population; and the very process by means of which necessary labour is reduced makes it possible to put new necessary labour (and hence surplus labour) to work. (I.e. the *production of workers* becomes cheaper, more workers can be produced in the same time, in proportion as *necessary labour time* becomes smaller or the time required for the *production of living labour capacity* becomes relatively smaller. These are identical statements.) (This still without regard to the fact that the increase in population increases the productive force of labour, since it makes possible a greater division and combination of labour etc. The increase of population is a *natural force* of labour, for which nothing is paid. From this standpoint, we use the term *natural force* to refer to the *social force*. All *natural forces of social labour* are themselves historical products.) It is, on the other side, a tendency of capital -- just as in the case of the single working day -- to reduce the many simultaneous necessary working days (which, as regards their value, can be taken as *one* working day) to the minimum, i.e. to posit as many as possible of them as *not necessary*. Just as in the previous case of the single working day it was a tendency of capital to reduce the necessary working hours, so now the necessary working days are reduced in relation to the total amount of objectified labour time. (If 6 are necessary to produce 12 superfluous working hours, then capital works towards the reduction of these 6 to 4. Or 6 working days can be regarded as one working day of 72 hours; if necessary labour time is reduced by 24 hours, then two days of necessary labour fall away -- i.e. 2 workers.) At the same time, the newly created surplus capital can be realized as such only by being again exchanged for living labour. Hence the tendency of capital simultaneously to increase the *labouring population* as well as to reduce constantly its *necessary* part (constantly to posit a part of it as reserve). And the increase of population itself the chief means []{#p401}for reducing the necessary part. *At bottom this is only an application of the relation of the single working day*. Here already lie, then, all the contradictions which modern population theory expresses as such, but does not grasp. Capital, as the positing of surplus labour, is equally and in the same moment the positing and the not-positing of necessary labour; it exists only in so far as necessary labour both exists and does not exist. [\*](#pagenote401){#pagenoter401}

If the relation of the necessary working days to the total number of objectified working days was = 9:12 (hence surplus labour = 1/4), then the striving of capital is to reduce it to 6:9 (i.e. 2/3, hence surplus labour = 1/3). (Develop this more closely later; still, the major basic traits here, where we are dealing with the general concept of capital.)

[\*](#pagenoter401){#pagenote401} It does not belong here, but can already be recalled here, that the creation of surplus labour on the one side corresponds to the creation of minus-labour, relative idleness (or *not-productive* labour at best), on the other. This goes without saying as regards capital itself; but holds then also for the classes with which it shares; hence of the paupers, flunkeys, lickspittles etc. living from the surplus product, in short, the whole train of retainers; the part of the *servant* \[*dienenden*\] class which lives not from capital but from revenue. Essential difference between this *servant* class and the *working* class. In relation to the whole of society, the creation of *disposable time* is then also creation of time for the production of science, art etc. The course of social development is by no means that because one individual has satisfied his need he then proceeds to create a superfluity for himself; but rather because one individual or class of individuals is forced to work more than required for the satisfaction of its need -- because *surplus labour* is on one side, therefore not-labour and surplus wealth are posited on the other. In reality the development of wealth exists only in these opposites \[*GegensÃ¤tze*\]: in potentiality, its development is the possibility of the suspension of these opposites.[^18] Or because an individual can satisfy *his own* need only by simultaneously satisfying the need of and providing a surplus above that for *another* individual. This brutal under slavery. Only under the conditions of wage labour does it lead to *industry, industrial* labour. -- Malthus therefore quite consistent when, along with surplus labour and surplus capital, he raises the demand for surplus idlers, consuming without producing, or the necessity of waste, luxury, lavish spending etc.

##### *Transition from the process of the production of capital into the process of circulation. -- Devaluation of capital itself owing to increase of productive forces. (Competition.)* (Capital *as unity and contradiction of production process and realization process.) Capital as barrier to production. -- Overproduction. (Demand by the workers themselves.) -- Barriers to capitalist production*

[]{#iiie1}

We have now seen how, in the *realization process,* capital has (1) maintained its value by means of exchange itself (exchange []{#p402} that is, with living labour); (2) increased, created a surplus value. There now appears, as the result of this unity of the process of production and the process of realization, the product of the process, i.e. capital itself, emerging as product from the process whose presupposition it was -- as a product which is a value, or, *value* itself appears as the product of the process, and specifically a *higher value,* because it contains more objectified labour than the value which formed the point of departure. This value as such is *money.* However, this is the case only *in itself;* it is not posited as such; that which is *posited* at the outset, which is on hand, is a commodity with a certain (ideal) price, i.e. which exists only ideally \[*ideell*\] as a certain sum of money, and which first has to *realize* itself \[*sich realisieren*\] as such in the exchange process, hence has to re-enter the process of simple circulation in order to be posited as *money.* We now come therefore to the *third side of the process* in which capital is posited as such.

\(3\) Looked at precisely, that is, the *realization process* of capital -- and money becomes capital only through the realization process -- appears at the same time as its *devaluation process* \[*Entwertungsprozess*\], its demonetization. And this in two respects. First, to the extent that capital does not increase absolute labour time but rather decreases the relative, necessary labour time, by increasing the force of production, to that extent does it reduce the costs of its own production -- in so far as it was presupposed as a certain sum of commodities, reduces its exchange value: one part of the capital on hand is constantly devalued owing to a decrease in the costs of production at which it can be *reproduced;* not because of a decrease in the amount of labour objectified in it, but because of a decrease in the amount of living labour which it is henceforth necessary to objectify in this specific product. This constant devaluation of the *existing* capital does not belong here, since it already presupposes capital as completed. It is merely to be noted here in order to indicate how later developments are already contained in the general concept of capital. Belongs in the []{#p403}doctrine of the concentration and competition of capitals. -- The *devaluation* being dealt with here is this, that capital has made the transition from the form of money into the form of a *commodity,* of a product, which has a certain price, which is to be *realized*. In its money form it existed as *value.* It now *exists* as product, and only ideally as price; but not as *value as* such. In order to *realize* itself, i.e. to maintain and to multiply itself as value, it would first have to make the transition from the form of money into that of use values (raw material -- instrument -- wages); but it would thereby lose the *form* of value; and it now has to enter anew into circulation in order to posit this form of general wealth anew. The capitalist now enters the process of circulation not simply as one engaged in exchange, but as *producer,* and the others engaged in exchange are, relative to him, *consumers.* They must exchange money in order to obtain his commodity for their consumption, while he exchanges his product to obtain their money. Suppose that this process breaks down -- and the separation by itself implies the possibility of such a miscarriage in the individual case -- then the capitalist's money has been transformed into a worthless product, and has not only not gained a new value, but also lost its original value. But whether this is so or not, in any case devaluation forms one moment of the realization process; which is already simply implied in the fact that the product of the process in its immediate form is not *value,* but first has to enter anew into circulation in order to be realized as such. Therefore, while capital is reproduced as value and new value in the production process, it is at the same time posited as *not-value,* as something which first has to be *realized as value by means of exchange.* The three processes of which capital forms the unity are external; they are separate in time and space. As such, the transition from one into the other, i.e. their unity as regards the individual capitalists, is accidental. Despite their *inner unity,* they exist *independently* alongside one another, each as the presupposition of the other. Regarded broadly and as a whole, this inner unity must necessarily maintain itself to the extent that the whole of production rests on capital, and it must therefore realize all the necessary moments of its self-formation, and must contain the determinants necessary to make these moments real. But at the point we have reached so far, capital still does not appear as the determinant of circulation (exchange) itself but merely as one moment of the latter, and it appears to stop being []{#p404} capital just at the point where it enters into circulation. As a *commodity,* capital now shares the fate of commodities in general; it is a matter of accident whether or not it is exchanged for money, whether its *price* is realized or not.

In the production process itself -- where capital continued to be presupposed as value -- its *realization* appeared totally dependent solely on the relation of itself as objectified labour to living labour; i.e. on the relation of capital to wage labour. But now, as a product, as a commodity, it appears dependent on circulation, which lies outside this process. (In fact, as we have seen, it returns into it as its ground, but also and equally emerges from it again.)[^19] As a commodity, it must be (1) a use value and, as such, an object of need, object of consumption; (2) it must be exchanged for its equivalent -- in money. The new value can be realized only through a sale.

If it contained objectified labour at a price of 100 thalers before, and now at a price of 110 (the price here merely an expression, in money, of the amount of objectified labour), then this has to be demonstrated through the exchange of the labour objectified in the newly produced commodity for 110 thalers. The product is devalued \[*entwertet*\] initially in so far as it must be exchanged for money at all, in order to obtain its form as value again. Inside the production process, realization appeared totally identical with the production of surplus labour (the objectification of surplus time), and hence appeared to have no *bounds* other than those partly presupposed and partly posited within this process itself, but which are always posited within it as *barriers* to be forcibly overcome. There now appear barriers to it which lie *outside* it. To begin with, even on an entirely superficial inspection, the commodity is an exchange value only in so far as it is at the same time a *use value,* i.e. an object of consumption (still entirely irrelevant here, what kind of consumption); it ceases to be an exchange value when it ceases to be a use value (since it does not yet exist as money again, but rather still in a specific mode of existence coinciding with its natural quality). Its first barrier, then, is *consumption itself --* the *need for it.* (Given the present presuppositions, there is no basis whatever for speaking of ineffective, *non-paying needs;* i.e. a need which does not itself possess a commodity or money to give in exchange.) Then, secondly, there has to be an equivalent for it, and, since circulation was []{#p405} presupposed at the outset as a constant magnitude -- as having a given volume -- but since, on the other hand, capital has created a new value in the production process, it seems indeed as if no equivalent were available for it. Thus, by emerging from the production process and re-entering circulation, capital (a) as *production,* appears to encounter a barrier in the available magnitude of *consumption --* of *consumption capacity.* As a specific use value, its quantity is irrelevant up to a certain point; then, however, at a certain level -- since it satisfies only a specific need -- it ceases to be required for consumption. As a *specific, one-sided, qualitative* use value, e.g. grain, its quantity itself is irrelevant only up to a certain level; it is required only in a specific quantity; i.e. in a certain *measure.* This measure, however, is given partly in its quality as use value -- its *specific* usefulness, applicability -- partly in the number of individuals engaged in exchange who have a need for this specific consumption. The number of consumers multiplied by the magnitude of their need for this *specific* product. Use value in itself does not have the boundlessness of value as such. Given objects can be consumed as objects of needs only up to a certain level. For example: No more than a certain amount of grain is consumed etc. Hence, as *use value,* the product contains a barrier -- precisely the barrier consisting of the need for it -- which, however, is measured not by the need of the producers but by the total need of all those engaged in exchange. Where the need for a certain use value ceases, it ceases to be a use value. It is measured as a use value by the need for it. But as soon is it ceases to be a use value, it ceases to be an object of circulation (in so far as it is not money). (b) As *new value* and as *value* as such, however, it seems to encounter a barrier in the magnitude of *available equivalents,* primarily money, not as medium of circulation but as money. The surplus value (distinct, obviously, from the original value) requires a surplus equivalent. This now appears as a second barrier.

\(c\) Money -- i.e. wealth as such, i.e. wealth existing in and because of the exchange for *alien objectified labour --* originally appeared to collapse into itself \[*in sich zusammenzufallen*\] to the extent that it did not proceed to the exchange for *alien living labour,* i.e. to the production process. Circulation was incapable of renewing itself from within itself. At the same time, the production process now appears to be in a fix, in as much as it is not able to make the transition into the process of circulation. Capital, as []{#p406} production resting on wage labour, presupposes circulation as the necessary condition and moment of the entire motion. This specific form of production presupposes this specific form of exchange which finds its expression in the circulation of money. In order to renew itself, the entire product has to be transformed into money; not as in earlier stages of production, where exchange is by no means concerned with production in its totality, but only with superfluous production and superfluous products.

These are, then, the contradictions which present themselves of their own accord to a simple, objective, non-partisan view. How they are constantly suspended in the system of production resting on capital, but also constantly created again -- and are suspended only by force (although this suspension appears up to a certain point merely as a quiet equilibration) -- this is another question. The important thing at present is to take note of the existence of these contradictions. All the contradictions of circulation come to life again in a new form. The product as use value is in contradiction with itself as value; i.e. in as much as it exists in a specific quality, as a specific thing, as a product of specific natural properties, as a substance of need in contradiction with its substance as value, which it possesses exclusively on account of its being *objectified labour.* But this time, this contradiction is posited not merely as it was in circulation, as a *merely formal difference*; rather the quality of being measured by use value is here firmly determined as the quality of being measured by the total requirement for this product by all those engaged in exchange -- i.e. by the amount of total consumption. The latter here appears as *measure* for it as use value and hence also as *exchange value.* In simple circulation it had simply to be transposed from the form of a particular use value into the form of exchange value. Its barrier then appeared only in the fact that, \[coming\] from circulation, it existed in a particular form owing to its *natural composition,* rather than in the value form in which it could be exchanged for all other commodities directly. What is posited now is that the *measure* of its availability is given in its *natural composition* itself. In order to be transposed into the general form, the use value has to be present in a limited and specific quantity; a *quantity* whose *measure* does not lie in the amount of *labour objectified in it,* but arises from its *nature as use value,* in particular, *use value for others.* At the same time, the previous contradiction, that money for-itself \[*das fÃ¼r sich seiende Geld*\] had to proceed to exchange []{#p407} itself for living labour, now appears even greater, in as much as the surplus money, in order to exist as such, or the surplus value, has to exchange itself for surplus value. Hence, as value, it encounters its barrier in alien production, just as, as use value, its barrier is alien consumption; in the latter, its measure is the amount of need for the specific product, in the former, the amount of *objectified labour* existing in circulation. The indifference of value as such towards use value is thereby brought into just as false a position \[*Position*\] as are, on the other side, the substance of value and its measure as objectified labour in general. [\*](#pagenote407){#pagenoter407}

[\*](#pagenoter407){#pagenote407} The transition to the relation of supply, demand, prices cannot be made yet, as their development proper presupposes capital. Should not demand and, supply, in so far as they are abstract categories and do not yet express any particular economic relations, perhaps be examined already together with simple circulation or production?

The main point here -- where we are concerned with the general concept of capital -- is that it is this *unity of production and realization,* not *immediately* but only as a *process,* which is linked to certain conditions, and, as it appeared, *external* conditions. [\*](#pagenote407_2){#pagenoter407_2}

[\*](#pagenoter407_2){#pagenote407_2} We saw earlier that the capital realization process presupposes the prior development of the *simple production process.*[^20] This will be the case with *demand and supply* as well, to the extent that simple exchange presupposes a need for the product. The (direct) producer's *own* need as the need for others' demand. In the course of this development itself it will be seen what has to be presupposed to it, and all this is then to be thrown into the first chapters.

The creation by capital of *absolute surplus value --* more objectified labour -- is conditional upon an expansion, specifically a constant expansion, of the sphere of circulation. The *surplus value* created at one point requires the creation of surplus value at *another* point, for which it may be exchanged; if only, initially, the production of more gold and silver, more money, so that, if surplus value cannot directly become capital again, it may exist in the form of money as the possibility of new capital. A precondition of production based on capital is therefore *the production of a constantly widening sphere of circulation,* whether the sphere itself is directly expanded or whether *more points within it are created as points of production.* While circulation appeared at first as a constant magnitude, it here appears as a moving magnitude, being expanded by production itself. Accordingly, it already appears as a moment of production itself. Hence, just as capital has the []{#p408} tendency on one side to create ever more surplus labour, so it has the complementary tendency to create more points of exchange; i.e., here, seen from the standpoint of *absolute* surplus value or surplus labour, to summon up more surplus labour as complement to itself; i.e. at bottom, to propagate production based on capital, or the mode of production corresponding to it. The tendency to create the *world market* is directly given in the concept of capital itself. Every limit appears as a barrier to be overcome. Initially, to subjugate every moment of production itself to exchange and to suspend the production of direct use values not entering into exchange, i.e. precisely to posit production based on capital in place of earlier modes of production, which appear primitive \[*naturwÃ¼chsig*\] from its standpoint. *Commerce* no longer appears here as a function taking place between independent productions for the exchange of their excess, but rather as an essentially all-embracing presupposition and moment of production itself. [\*](#pagenote408){#pagenoter408}

[\*](#pagenoter408){#pagenote408} Of course, all production aimed at direct use value decreases the number of those engaged in exchange, as well as the sum of exchange values thrown into circulation, and above all the production of surplus values. Hence the tendency of capital (1) continually to enlarge the periphery of circulation; (2) to transform it at all points into production spurred on by capital.[^21]

On the other side, the production of *relative surplus value,* i.e. production of surplus value based on the increase and development of the productive forces, requires the production of new consumption; requires that the consuming circle within circulation expands as did the productive circle previously. Firstly quantitative expansion of existing consumption; secondly: creation of new needs by propagating existing ones in a wide circle; *thirdly:* production of *new* needs and discovery and creation of new use values. In other words, so that the surplus labour gained does not remain a merely quantitative surplus, but rather constantly increases the circle of qualitative differences within labour (hence of surplus labour), makes it more diverse, more internally differentiated. For example, if, through a doubling of productive force, a capital of 50 can now do what a capital of 100 did before, so that a capital of 50 and the necessary labour corresponding to it become free, then, for the capital and labour which have been []{#p409} set free, a new, qualitatively different branch of production must be created, which satisfies and brings forth a new need. The value of the old industry is preserved by the creation of the fund for a new one in which the relation of capital and labour posits itself in a *new* form. Hence exploration of all of nature in order to discover new, useful qualities in things; universal exchange of the products of all alien climates and lands; new (artificial) preparation of natural objects, by which they are given new use values. [\*](#pagenote409){#pagenoter409} The exploration of the earth in all directions, to discover new things of use as well as new useful qualities of the old; such as new qualities of them as raw materials etc.; the development, hence, of the natural sciences to their highest point; likewise the discovery, creation and satisfaction of new needs arising from society itself; the cultivation of all the qualities of the social human being, production of the same in a form as rich as possible in needs, because rich in qualities and relations -- production of this being as the most total and universal possible social product, for, in order to take gratification in a many-sided way, he must be capable of many pleasures \[*genussfÃ¤hig*\], hence cultured to a high degree -- is likewise a condition of production founded on capital. This creation of new branches of production, i.e. of qualitatively new surplus time, is not merely the division of labour, but is rather the creation, separate from a given production, of labour with a new use value; the development of a constantly expanding and more comprehensive system of different kinds of labour, different kinds of production, to which a constantly expanding and constantly enriched system of needs corresponds.

[\*](#pagenoter409){#pagenote409} The role played by *luxury* in antiquity in contrast to its role among the moderns, to be alluded to later.

Thus, just as production founded on capital creates universal industriousness on one side -- i.e. surplus labour, value-creating labour -- so does it create on the other side a system of general exploitation of the natural and human qualities, a system of general utility, utilizing science itself just as much as all the physical and mental qualities, while there appears nothing *higher in itself,* nothing legitimate for itself, outside this circle of social production and exchange. Thus capital creates the bourgeois society, and the universal appropriation of nature as well as of the social bond itself by the members of society. Hence the great civilizing influence of capital; its production of a stage of society in comparison to which all earlier ones appear as mere *local* []{#p410} *developments* of humanity and as *nature-idolatry.* For the first time, nature becomes purely an object for humankind, purely a matter of utility; ceases to be recognized as a power for itself; and the theoretical discovery of its autonomous laws appears merely as a ruse so as to subjugate it under human needs, whether as an object of consumption or as a means of production. In accord with this tendency, capital drives beyond national barriers and prejudices as much as beyond nature worship, as well as all traditional, confined, complacent, encrusted satisfactions of present needs, and reproductions of old ways of life. It is destructive towards all of this, and constantly revolutionizes it, tearing down all the barriers which hem in the development of the forces of production, the expansion of needs, the all-sided development of production, and the exploitation and exchange of natural and mental forces.

But from the fact that capital posits every such limit as a barrier and hence gets *ideally* beyond it, it does not by any means follow that it has *really* overcome it, and, since every such barrier contradicts its character, its production moves in contradictions which are constantly overcome but just as constantly posited. Furthermore. The universality towards which it irresistibly strives encounters barriers in its own nature, which will, at a certain stage of its development, allow it to be recognized as being itself the greatest barrier to this tendency, and hence will drive towards its own suspension.

Those economists who, like Ricardo, conceived production as directly identical with the self-realization of capital -- and hence were heedless of the barriers to consumption or of the existing barriers of circulation itself, to the extent that it must represent counter-values at all points, having in view only the development of the forces of production and the growth of the industrial population -- supply without regard to demand -- have therefore grasped the positive essence of capital more correctly and deeply than those who, like Sismondi, emphasized the barriers of consumption and of the available circle of counter-values, although the latter has better grasped the limited nature of production based on capital, its negative one-sidedness. The former more its universal tendency, the latter its particular restrictedness. The whole dispute as to whether *overproduction* is possible and necessary in capitalist production revolves around the point whether the process of the realization of capital within production directly []{#p411} posits its realization in circulation; whether its realization posited in the *production process* is its *real* realization. Ricardo himself, of course, has a suspicion that the *exchange value* of a commodity is not a value apart from exchange, and that it proves itself as a value only in exchange; but he regards the barriers which production thereby encounters as accidental, as barriers which are overcome. He therefore conceives the overcoming of such barriers as being in the essence of capital, although he often becomes absurd in the exposition of that view; while Sismondi, by contrast, emphasizes not only the encounter with the barriers, but their creation by capital itself, and has a vague intuition that they must lead to its breakdown. He therefore wants to put up barriers to production, from the outside, through custom, law etc., which of course, as merely external and artificial barriers, would necessarily be demolished by capital. On the other side, Ricardo and his entire school never understood the really *modern crises,* in which this contradiction of capital discharges itself in great thunderstorms which increasingly threaten it as the foundation of society and of production itself.

The attempts made from the orthodox economic standpoint to deny that there is *general overproduction* at any given moment are indeed childish. Either, in order to rescue production *based on capital* (see e.g. MacCulloch),[^22] all its specific qualities are ignored and their specific character as forms omitted, and capital is conceived as its inverse, as simple production for *immediate use value.* Totally abstracts away the essential relations. In fact, in order to cleanse it of contradictions, it is virtually dropped and negated.[^23] -- Or, like e.g. Mill, more perceptively (copied from the dull Say): *supply* and *demand* are allegedly identical, and should therefore necessarily correspond.[^24] Supply, namely, is allegedly a demand measured by its own amount. Here a great confusion: (1) This identity of supply, so that it is a demand measured by its own amount, is true only to the extent that it is *exchange value =* to a certain amount of objectified labour. To that extent it is the []{#p412} measure of its own demand -- as far as *value* is concerned. But, as such a value, it first has to be realized through the exchange for *money,* and as object of exchange for money it depends (2) on its *use value,* but as use value it depends on the mass of needs present for it, the demand for it. But as use value it is absolutely not measured by the labour time objectified in it, but rather a measuring rod is applied to it which lies outside its nature as exchange value. Or, it is further said: *Supply itself is demand for a certain product* of a *certain value* (which expresses itself in the demanded amount of the product). Then, if the supplied product is unsaleable, it proves that too much has been produced of the supplied commodity and too little of what the supplier demands. Thus allegedly there is no general overproduction, but merely overproduction of one or a few articles, as against underproduction of others. This again forgets that what the producing capital demands is not a specific use value, but *value* for itself, i.e. money -- money not in the role of medium of circulation, but as a general form of wealth, or a form of the realization of capital in one regard, a return to its original dormant state in the other. But the assertion that too little *money* is produced means indeed nothing else than what is being asserted, that production is not identical with realization, i.e. that it is *overproduction,* or, what is the same, that it is production which cannot be transformed into money, into *value;* production which does not pass the test of circulation. Hence the illusion of the money-artists (including Proudhon etc.), that it is a case of lack of *means of circulation --* on account of the high cost of money -- and that more money has to be created artificially.[^25] (See also the Birminghamites, e.g. the *Gemini*.)[^26] Or it is said that *production and consumption* are the same *from the social standpoint,* that hence an excess or disproportion between the two can never take place. Social standpoint here means the abstraction which ignores precisely the specific social structure and relations and hence also the contradictions which emerge from it. Storch, for example, remarked quite correctly against Say that a great part of consumption is not consumption for immediate use, but consumption in the production process, []{#p413} e.g. consumption of machines, coal, oil, required buildings etc.[^27] This consumption is in no way identical with that at issue here. Malthus and Sismondi have likewise correctly remarked that e.g. the workers' consumption is in no way in itself a *sufficient* consumption for the capitalist.[^28] The moment of realization is here simply thrown out entirely, and production and consumption are simply equated, i.e. not production based on capital but production based directly on *use value* is presupposed. Or, expressed *socialistically*:[^29] labour and the exchange of labour, i.e. production and its exchange (circulation), are allegedly the entire process; how then could a disproportion arise except by oversight, miscalculation? Labour is here regarded not as wage labour, nor capital as capital. On one side, the consequences of production based on capital are accepted, on the other side the presuppositions and conditions of these consequences are denied -- necessary labour as posited by and for surplus labour. Or -- e.g. Ricardo -- since production is itself regulated by the costs of production, it allegedly regulates itself, and if one branch of production does not realize itself then capital withdraws from it to a certain degree and throws itself on another point where it is needed.[^30] But apart from the fact that this necessity of evening-up already *presupposes* the unevenness, the disharmony and hence the contradiction -- in a general crisis of overproduction the contradiction is not between the different kinds of productive capital, but between industrial and loanable capital -- between capital as directly involved in the production process and capital as money existing (relatively) outside of it. Finally: *proportionate production* (this is already in Ricardo also, etc.) only when it is capital's tendency to distribute itself in correct proportions, but equally its necessary tendency -- since it strives limitlessly for surplus labour, surplus productivity, surplus consumption etc. -- to drive beyond the proportion. (In *competition* this inner tendency of capital appears as a compulsion exercised over it by *alien capital,* which drives it forward beyond the correct proportion with a constant *march, march!* Free competition, as Mr Wakefield []{#p414} correctly sniffs out in his commentary on Smith, has *never yet* been developed by the economists, no matter how much they prattle about it, and \[no matter\] how much it is the basis of the entirety of bourgeois production, production resting on capital.[^31] It has been understood only negatively: i.e. as negation of monopolies, the guild system, legal regulations etc. As negation of feudal production. But it also has to be something *for itself,* after all, since a mere 0 is an empty negation, abstraction, from a barrier which immediately arises again e.g. in the form of monopoly, natural monopolies etc. Conceptually, *competition* is nothing other than the inner *nature of capital,* its essential character, appearing in and realized as the reciprocal interaction of many capitals with one another, the inner tendency as external necessity.) (Capital exists and can only exist as many capitals, and its self-determination therefore appears as their reciprocal interaction with one another.) Capital is just as much the constant positing as the suspension of *proportionate production.* The existing proportion always has to be suspended by the creation of surplus values and the increase of productive forces. But this demand, that production should be expanded *simultaneously* and *at once in the same proportion,* makes external demands upon capital which in no way arise out of it itself; at the same time, the departure from the given proportion in one branch of production drives all of them out of it, and in unequal proportions. So far (for we have not yet reached the aspect of capital in which it is *circulating capital,* and still have circulation on one side and capital on the other, or production as its presupposition, or ground from which it arises), even from the standpoint of production alone, circulation contains the relation to consumption and production -- in other words, surplus labour as counter value \[*Gegenwert*\], and differentiation of labour in an ever richer form.

The simple concept of capital has to contain its civilizing tendencies etc. *in themselves;* they must not, as in the economics books until now, appear merely as external consequences. Likewise the contradictions which are later released, demonstrated as already latent within it.

So far in the realization process, we have only the indifference of the individual moments towards one another; that they determine each other internally and search for each other externally; []{#p415} but that they may or may not find each other, balance each other, correspond to each other. The inner necessity of moments which belong together, and their indifferent, independent existence towards one another, are already a foundation of contradictions.

Still, we are by no means finished. The contradiction between production and realization -- of which capital, by its concept, is the unity -- has to be grasped more intrinsically than merely as the indifferent, seemingly reciprocally independent appearance of the individual moments of the process, or rather of the totality of processes.

To approach the matter more closely: *First of all, there is a limit, not inherent to production generally, but to production founded on capital.* This limit is double, or rather the same regarded from two directions. It is enough here to demonstrate that capital contains a *particular* restriction of production -- which contradicts its general tendency to drive beyond every barrier to production -- in order to have uncovered the foundation of *overproduction,* the fundamental contradiction of developed capital; in order to have uncovered, more generally, the fact that capital is not, as the economists believe, the *absolute* form for the development of the forces of production -- not the absolute form for that, nor the form of wealth which absolutely coincides with the development of the forces of production. The stages of production which precede capital appear, regarded from its standpoint, as so many fetters upon the productive forces. It itself, however, correctly understood, appears as the condition of the development of the forces of production as long as they require an external spur, which appears at the same time as their bridle. It is a discipline over them, which becomes superfluous and burdensome at a certain level of their development, just like the guilds etc. These inherent limits have to coincide with the nature of capital, with the essential character of its very concept. These necessary limits are:

\(1\) *Necessary labour* as limit on the exchange value of living labour capacity or of the woes of the industrial population;

\(2\) *Surplus value* as limit on surplus labour time; and, in regard to relative surplus labour time, as barrier to the development of the forces of production;

\(3\) What is the same, the *transformation into money,* exchange value as such, as limit of production; or exchange founded on []{#p416} value, or value founded on exchange, as limit of production. This is:

\(4\) again the same as *restriction of the production of use values by exchange value;* or that real wealth has to take on a *specific* form distinct from itself, a form not absolutely identical with it, in order to become an object of production at all.

However, these limits come up against the *general tendency of capital* (which showed itself in simple circulation, where money as medium of circulation appeared as merely vanishing, without independent necessity, and hence not as limit and barrier) to forget and abstract from:

\(1\) necessary labour as limit of the exchange value of living labour capacity; (2) surplus value as the limit of surplus labour and development of the forces of production; (3) money as the limit of production; (4) the restriction of the production of use values by exchange value.

Hence overproduction: i.e. the sudden *recall* of all these necessary moments of production founded on capital; hence general devaluation in consequence of forgetting them. Capital, at the same time, \[is\] thereby faced with the task of launching its attempt anew from a higher level of the development of productive forces, with each time greater collapse *as capital.* Clear, therefore, that the higher the development of capital, the more it appears as barrier to production -- hence also to consumption -- besides the other contradictions which make it appear as burdensome barrier to production and intercourse.

\<The entire *credit system,* and the over-trading, over-speculation etc. connected with it, rests on the necessity of expanding and leaping over the barrier to circulation and the sphere of exchange. This appears more colossally, classically, in the relations between peoples than in the relations between individuals. Thus e.g. the English forced to *lend* to foreign nations, in order to have them as customers. At bottom, the English capitalist exchanges doubly with *productive* English capital, (1) as himself, (2) as Yankee etc. or in whatever other form he has placed his money.\>

\<Capital as *barrier to production* is pointed out: e.g. Hodgskin:[^32] 'In the present state, every accumulation of capital adds to the []{#p417} amount of profit demanded from the labourer, and extinguishes all that labour which would only procure the labourer his comfortable existence ... *Profit* the limitation of production.' (H\[odgskin, Notebook,\] p. 46.)[^33] Through foreign trade, the barrier of the sphere of exchange \[is\] expanded, and \[it is\] made possible for the capitalist to consume more surplus labour: 'In a series of years the world can take no more from us than we can take from the world. Even the profits made by our merchants in their foreign trade are paid by the consumer of the return goods here. Foreign trade mere barter, and as such exchange for the convenience and enjoyment of the capitalist. But he can consume commodities to a certain degree only. He exchanges cottons etc. for the wines and silks of foreign countries. But these *represent only the surplus labour of our own population* as much as the clothes and cottons, and in this way the *destructive power of the capitalist is increased beyond all bounds.* Thus nature is *outwitted.' (Source and Remedy* etc., pp. 27, 28.)[^34] How the *glut* is connected with the *barrier* of necessary labour: 'The very meaning of an increased demand by the labourers is, a disposition to take less themselves, and leave a larger share for their employers; and if it be said that this, *by diminishing consumption, increases glut,* I can only say that *glut then is synonymous with high profits.' (Enquiry,* London, 1821, p. 12.)[^35] Herein the one side of the contradiction completely expressed. 'The practice of stopping labour at that point where it can produce, in addition to the subsistence of the labourer, a profit for the capitalist, opposed to the natural law which regulates production.' (H\[odgskin, Notebook,\] 41, IX.)[^36] 'The more the capital accumulates, the more the *whole amount of profit demanded does so;* so there arises an *artificial check* to production and population.' (H\[odgskin, Notebook,\] 46.)[^37] The contradictions between capital as instrument of production in general and as instrument of production of value, developed as follows by Malthus (X, 40 seq.): 'Profits are invariably measured by *value* and never by *quantity ...* The *wealth* of a []{#p418} country depends partly upon the *quantity of produce* obtained by its labour, and partly upon *such an adaptation of this quantity to the wants and powers of the existing population* as is calculated to give it value. Nothing can be more certain than that it is not determined by either of them alone. But where wealth and value are perhaps the most nearly connected, is in *the necessity of the latter to the production of the former.* The value set upon commodities, that is the sacrifice of labour which people are willing to make in order to sustain them, in the actual state of things may be said to be *almost the sole cause* of the existence of wealth ... The consumptive demand occasioned only by the workmen employed in productive labour can never *alone* furnish a motive to the accumulation and employment of capital ... *the powers of production alone do not secure the creation of a proportionate degree of wealth,* as little as the *increase of population.* What it requires in addition is *such a distribution of produce,* and such an adaptation of this produce to the wants of those who are to consume it, as constantly to increase *the exchangeable value of the whole mass,* i.e. the powers of production are only called fully into motion by the unchecked demand for all that is produced ...[^38] This is however brought about on the one hand by constantly new branches of industry (and *reciprocal* expansion of the old), by means of which the old obtain new *markets* etc. Production indeed itself creates demand, in that it employs more workers in the same branch of business, and creates new branches of business, where new capitalists again employ new workers and at the same time alternately become market for the old; but the demand created by the productive labourer himself can never be an *adequate* demand, because it does not go to the full extent of what he produces. If it did, there would be no profit, consequently no motive to employ him. The very existence of a profit upon any commodity presupposes *a demand exterior to that of the labourer who has produced it.*' 'Both labourers and capital may be redundant compared with the means of employing them profitably.'\>[^39]

\<To be noted for (3), to which we shall soon proceed, that the provisional accumulation, as which capital appears *vis-Ã -vis* labour, and by means of which it is the command over labour, is []{#p419} at first nothing else but *surplus labour* itself in the form of *surplus produce,* at the same time *claim on alien co-existing labour.*\>

The point here, of course, is not yet to develop overproduction specifically, but only the predisposition to it, such as it is posited in primitive form in the capital relation itself. We must also, therefore, omit here any regard for the other possessing and consuming etc. classes, which do not produce but live from their revenue, hence exchange with capital; form centres of exchange for it. We can consider them only partly (but better, along with *accumulation*), in so far as they are most important for the historic formation of capital.

In production based on slavery, as well as in patriarchal agricultural-industrial production, where the greatest part of the population directly satisfies the greatest part of its needs directly by its labour, the sphere of circulation and exchange is still very narrow; and more particularly in the former, the slave does not come into consideration as *engaged in exchange* at all. But in production based on capital, consumption is mediated at all points by exchange, and labour never has a *direct* use value for those who are working. Its entire basis is labour as exchange value and as the creation of exchange value.

Well. First of all

the wage worker as distinct from the slave is himself an independent centre of circulation, someone who exchanges, posits exchange value, and maintains exchange value through exchange. *Firstly:* in the exchange between that part of capital which is specified as wages, and living labour capacity, the *exchange value* of this part of capital is posited immediately, before capital again emerges from the production process to enter into circulation, or this can be conceived as itself still an act of circulation. *Secondly:* To each capitalist, the total mass of all workers, with the exception of his own workers, appear not as workers, but as consumers, possessors of exchange values (wages), money, which they exchange for his commodity. They are so many centres of circulation with whom the act of exchange begins and by whom the exchange value of capital is maintained. They form a proportionally very great part -- although not quite so great as is generally imagined, if one focuses on the industrial worker proper -- of all consumers. The greater their number -- the number of the industrial population -- and the mass of money at their disposal, the greater the sphere of exchange for capital. We have seen that it is the tendency []{#p420} of capital to increase the industrial population as much as possible.

Actually, the relation of one capitalist to the workers of *another* capitalist is none of our concern here. It only shows every capitalist's illusion, but alters nothing in the relation of capital in general to labour. Every capitalist knows this about his worker, that he does not relate to him as producer to consumer, and \[he therefore\] wishes to restrict his consumption, i.e. his ability to exchange, his wage, as much as possible. Of course he would like the workers of *other* capitalists to be the greatest consumers possible of *his own* commodity. But the relation of *every* capitalist to *his own* workers is the *relation as such* of *capital and labour,* the essential relation. But this is just how the illusion arises -- true for the individual capitalist as distinct from all the others -- that *apart from his* workers the whole remaining working class confronts him as *consumer* and *participant in exchange,* as money-spender, and not as worker. It is forgotten that, as Malthus says, 'the very existence of a profit upon any commodity pre-supposes a *demand exterior to that of the labourer who has produced it',*[^40] and hence the *demand of the labourer himself can never be an adequate demand.* Since one production sets the other into motion and hence creates consumers for itself in the *alien* capital's workers, it *seems* to each individual capital that the demand of the working class posited by production itself is an 'adequate demand'. On one side, this demand which production itself posits drives it forward, and must drive it forward beyond the *proportion* in which it would have to produce with regard to the workers; on the other side, if the demand *exterior to the demand of the labourer himself* disappears or shrinks up, then the collapse occurs. Capital itself then regards *demand by the worker --* i.e. the payment of the wages on which this demand rests -- not as a gain but as a loss. I.e. the *immanent relation between capital and labour* asserts itself. *Here again it is the competition among capitals,* their indifference to and independence of one another, which brings it about that the individual capital relates to the workers of the entire remaining capital *not as to workers:* hence is driven beyond the right proportion. What precisely distinguishes capital from the master-servant relation is that the *worker* confronts him as consumer and possessor of exchange values, and that in the form of the []{#p421} *possessor of money,* in the form of money he becomes a simple centre of circulation -- one of its infinitely many centres, in which his specificity as worker is extinguished. [\*](#pagenote421){#pagenoter421}

[\*](#pagenoter421){#pagenote421} It is quite the same with the demand created by production itself for raw material, semi-finished goods, machinery, means of communication, and for the auxiliary materials consumed in production, such as dyes, coal, grease, soap, etc. This effective, exchange-value-positing demand is adequate and sufficient as long as the producers exchange among themselves. Its inadequacy shows itself as soon as the final product encounters its limit in direct and final consumption. This *semblance,* too, which drives beyond the correct proportion, is founded in the essence of capital, which, as will be developed more closely in connection with competition, *is* something which repels itself, *is* many capitals mutually quite indifferent to one another. In so far as one capitalist *buys* from others, buys commodities, or sells, they are within the simple exchange relation; and do not relate to one another as capital. The *correct* (imaginary) proportion in which they must exchange with one another in order to realize themselves at the end as capital lies *outside* their relation to one another.

To begin with: capital forces the workers beyond necessary labour to surplus labour. Only in this way does it realize itself, and create surplus value. But on the other hand, it posits necessary labour only *to the extent* and *in so far as* it is surplus labour and the latter is *realizable* as *surplus value.* It posits surplus labour, then, as the condition of the necessary, and surplus value as the limit of objectified labour, of value as such. As soon as it cannot posit value, it does not posit necessary labour; and, given its foundation, it cannot be otherwise. It therefore restricts labour and the creation of value -- by an artificial check, as the English express it -- and it does so on the same grounds as and to the same extent that it posits surplus labour and surplus value. By its nature, therefore, it posits a *barrier* to labour and value-creation, in contradiction to its tendency to expand them boundlessly. And in as much as it both posits a barrier *specific* to itself, and on the other side equally drives over and beyond *every* barrier, it is the living contradiction. [\*](#pagenote421_2){#pagenoter421_2}

[\*](#pagenoter421_2){#pagenote421_2} Since value forms the foundation of capital, and since it therefore necessarily exists only through exchange for *counter-value,* it thus necessarily repels itself from itself. A *universal capital,* one without alien capitals confronting it, with which it exchanges -- and from the present standpoint, nothing confronts it but wage labourers or itself -- is therefore a non-thing. The reciprocal repulsion between capitals is already contained in capital as realized exchange value.

While capital thus, on one side, makes surplus labour and its *exchange* for *surplus labour* into the precondition of necessary []{#p422} labour and hence of the positing of *labour capacity* \[*ArbeitsvermÃ¶gen*\] as a centre of exchange -- hence already narrows and attaches conditions to the sphere of exchange from this side -- it is just as essential to it, on the other side, to restrict the worker's consumption to the amount necessary to reproduce his labour capacity -- to make the value which expresses *necessary labour* the barrier to the realization of labour capacity and hence of the worker's *exchange capacity,* and to strive to reduce the relation of this necessary labour to surplus labour to the minimum. \[Thus we have\] a new barrier to the sphere of exchange, which is, however, at the same time identical, as is the first, with the tendency of capital to relate to every limit on its self-realization as to a barrier. The boundless enlargement of its value -- boundless creation of value -- therefore absolutely identical here with the positing of barriers to the sphere of exchange, i.e. the possibility of realization -- the realization of the value posited in the production process.

The same with the *productive force.* On the one hand, the necessary tendency of capital to raise it to the utmost, in order to increase relative *surplus time.* On the other hand, thereby decreases *necessary labour time,* hence the worker's exchange capacity. Further, as we have seen, relative *surplus value* rises much more slowly than the force of production, and moreover this proportion grows ever smaller as the magnitude reached by the productive forces is greater. *But the mass of products grows in a similar proportion --* if not, then new capital would be set free -- as well as labour -- which did not enter into circulation. But to the same degree as the mass of products grows, so grows the difficulty of realizing the labour time contained in them -- because the demands made on consumption rise. (We are still concerned here only with the way in which the capital *realization process* is its *devaluation process.* Out of place here would be the question how, while it has the tendency to *heighten the productive forces boundlessly,* it *also and equally* makes one-sided, limits etc. the *main force of production, the human being himself,* and has the tendency in general to restrict the forces of production.)

Capital, then, posits *necessary labour time* as the barrier to the exchange value of living labour capacity; *surplus labour time* as the barrier to necessary labour time; and *surplus value* as the barrier to surplus labour time; while at the same time it drives over and beyond all these barriers, to the extent that it posits []{#p423} *labour capacity* opposite itself as something simply engaged in exchange, as money, and surplus labour time as the only barrier, because creatrix of surplus value. (Or, from the first aspect, it posits the exchange of surplus values as the barrier to the exchange of the necessary values.)

In one and the same moment, it posits the *values on hand* in circulation -- or, what is the same, the proportion of values posited by it to the values contained in it and *presupposed* in circulation -- as the barrier, the necessary barrier to its value-creation; on the other hand, its productivity as the only barrier and creatrix of values. It therefore drives constantly on one side towards its own devaluation, on the other side towards the obstruction of the productive forces, and of labour which objectifies itself in values.

##### *Overproduction. -- Proudhon (How is it possible that in the price of the commodity which the worker buys, he pays the profit etc. and still obtains his necessary wages). -- Price of the commodity and labour time. Surplus etc. (*Price *and value etc.) -- Capitalist does not sell* too dear; *but still above what the thing costs him. -- Price (fractional). Bastiat. Decline of the fractional price. -- Price can fall below value without damage to capital. Number and unit (measure) important in the multiplication of prices*

\<This nonsense about the impossibility of overproduction (in other words, the assertion of the immediate identity of capital's process of production and its process of realization) has been expressed in a manner which is at least sophistical, i.e. ingenious, as mentioned above,[^41] by James Mill, in the formula that supply = its own demand, that supply and demand therefore balance, which means in other words the same thing as that value is determined by labour time, and hence that *exchange adds nothing to it,* and which forgets only that exchange does have to take place and that this depends (in the final instance) on the *use value.* Mill says, then, that if demand and supply do not balance, this comes about because too much has been produced of one specific product (the supplied product) and too little of the other (the one in demand). This too much and too little concerns not the exchange value, but the use value. More of the supplied product exists than is 'needed'; this is what it boils down to. Hence that []{#p424} overproduction comes from use value and therefore from exchange itself. This in stultified form in Say -- products are exchanged only for products;[^42] therefore, at most, too much has been produced of one and too little of another. Forgetting: (1) that values are exchanged for values, and a product exchanges for another only to the extent that it is value; i.e. that it is or becomes money; (2) it exchanges for labour. The good gentleman adopts the standpoint of *simple exchange,* in which indeed no overproduction is possible, for it is indeed concerned not with exchange value but with use value. Overproduction takes place in connection with realization, not otherwise.[^43]\>

Proudhon, who certainly hears the bells ringing but never knows where, therefore sees the origin of overproduction in the fact 'that the worker cannot buy back his product'.[^44] By this he understands that interest and profit are added on to it; or that the price of the product is an overcharge on top of its real value. This demonstrates first of all that he understands nothing about the determination of value, which, generally speaking, can include no overcharge. In practical commerce, capitalist A can screw capitalist B. The one pockets what the other loses. If we add them both together, then the sum of their exchange = the sum of the labour time objectified in it, of which capitalist A has merely pocketed more than his share in relation to B. From all the profits made by capital, i.e. the total mass of capitalists, there is deducted (1) the constant part of capital; (2) the wage, or, the amount of objectified labour time necessary in order to reproduce living labour capacity. They can therefore divide nothing among themselves other than the surplus value. The proportion -- just or unjust -- in which they distribute this surplus value among themselves alters absolutely nothing about exchange or about the exchange relation between capital and labour.

It might be said that *necessary labour time* (i.e. the wage), which therefore excludes profit, and is rather to be deducted from it, is itself again determined by the *prices* of products which already include profit. Where else could the profit come from which the capitalist who does not directly employ this worker makes in the exchange with him? For example, the spinner's worker exchanges his wages for so many bushels of grain. But in []{#p425} the price of each bushel, the profit of the farmer, i.e. of capital, is already included. So that the *price* of the consumption goods which are bought by necessary labour itself already includes surplus labour time. It is clear, first of all, that the wage paid by the spinner to his workmen must be high enough to buy the necessary bushel of wheat, regardless of what profit for the farmer may be included in the *price* of the bushel of wheat; but that, likewise, on the other side, the wage which the farmer pays his workers must be high enough to procure for them the necessary quantity of clothing, regardless of what profit for the weaver and the spinner may be included in the *price* of these articles of clothing.

The puzzle arises simply because (1) *price* and *value* are being mixed up; (2) relations are brought in which are irrelevant to the determination of value of such. Suppose initially -- and this is the conceptual relation -- that capitalist A himself produces all the consumption goods which the worker needs, or which represent the sum of use values in which his necessary labour objectifies itself. Then, with the money which he obtains from the capitalist -- money appears in this transaction only as medium of circulation -- the worker would have to buy back from the capitalist, with that money, a fractional part -- the part representing his necessary labour -- of his product. The *price* of a fractional part of capitalist A's product is of course the same for the worker as for everyone else engaged in exchange. From the moment he buys from the capitalist, his specific quality as worker is extinguished; the money contains no trace of the relation in which, or of the operation by which, it was obtained; in circulation he confronts the capitalist simply as M, and the capitalist confronts him as C; as realizer of the *price* of C, which is hence presupposed for him just as for every other representative of M, i.e. buyer. Good. But in the price of the fractional part of the commodity which he buys, the profit is included in which the surplus value going to the capitalist appears. If his necessary labour time, therefore, represents 20 thalers = a certain fractional part of the product, it follows that, if the profit is 10%, the capitalist sells him the commodity for 22 thalers.

That is what Proudhon thinks, and concludes from it that the worker cannot buy back his product, i.e. the fractional part of the total product which objectifies his *necessary labour.* (We will come back directly to his other conclusion, that *therefore* capital []{#p426} cannot adequately exchange, *hence* overproduction.) To make the matter tangible, say that the worker's 20 thalers = 4 bushels of grain. Consequently -- if 20 thalers is the value of the 4 bushels expressed in money -- if the capitalist sells them for 22, then the worker could not buy back the 4 bushels, or rather he could buy only 3 7/11 bushels. In other words, he imagines that the monetary transaction distorts the relation. 20 thalers is the price of necessary labour = 4 bushels; and the capitalist pays this to the worker; but as soon as the latter presents his 20 thalers and asks for the 4 bushels, he gets only 3 7/11. Since he would thereby receive less than the *necessary* wage, he could not live at all, and thus Mr Proudhon proves more than he intends. [\*](#pagenote426){#pagenoter426}

[\*](#pagenoter426){#pagenote426} It is beside the point here that capital, in practice as well as in general tendency, directly employs *price,* as e.g. in the truck system, to defraud *necessary labour,* and to reduce it below the standard given by nature as well as by a specific state of society. We must always presuppose here that the wage paid is *economically* just, i.e. that it is determined by the general laws of economics. The contradictions have to follow here from the general relations themselves, and not from fraud by individual capitalists. The further forms which this assumes in reality belong in the doctrine of wages.

But the presupposition, if you please, is wrong. If 5 thalers expresses the *value* of a bushel, i.e. the labour time objectified in it, and if 4 bushels express the necessary wages of labour, then capitalist A sells these 4 bushels not, as Proudhon thinks, for 22 but for 20 thalers. But the thing is this: let the total product (including necessary and surplus labour time) equal 110 thalers = 22 bushels; let 16 of these bushels = 80 thalers, represent the capital invested in seed, machinery etc.; 4 bushels = 20 thalers for necessary labour time; 2 bushels = 10 thalers, surplus labour time. The capitalist sells each bushel at 5 thalers, the necessary value of the bushel, and nevertheless he makes a gain of 10% on each bushel, or 5/10 of a thaler, 1/2 a thaler = 15 silver groschen. How? Because he sells 22 Ã 5 instead of 20 Ã 5. We can here equate to 0 the additional capital he would have to lay out in order to produce 2 additional bushels, since these can dissolve in pure surplus labour, more thorough ploughing, elimination of weeds, procurement of mineral fertilizer which, say, costs him nothing, etc. The value contained in the 2 surplus bushels has cost *him nothing,* hence makes up a surplus above his expenditures. If he sells 20 of the 22 bushels for what they cost him, for 100 thalers, plus 2, which cost him nothing -- but whose value = the labour contained in them -- for 10 thalers, then it is the same for []{#p427} him as if he sold all of them, each bushel for 15 silver groschen more than it cost him. (For 1/2 a thaler or 10% of 5 thalers = 5/10.) Therefore, although he makes 2 thalers on the 4 bushels he sells to the worker, the worker obtains each bushel at its necessary value. The capitalist makes 2 thalers on them only because, beside these 4 bushels, he sells 18 additional ones at the identical price. If he sold only 16, he would make nothing; for then he would sell a total of: 5 Ã 20 =100, his invested capital.

Indeed, in manufacturing, too, it is possible that the capital's outlays do not increase, while a surplus value is sold nevertheless; i.e. it is not necessary that the outlay in raw material and machinery should grow. Assume that the same product obtains a higher finish through labour by hand -- the mass of required raw material and instrument held constant -- and hence its use value, therefore the use value of the product, increases, not in quantity, but in quality, owing to the increased hand labour employed on it. Its exchange value -- the labour objectified in it -- simply grows in relation to this labour. If the capitalist then sells for 10% more, then the worker gets paid the fractional part of the product, expressed in money, which represents necessary labour; and if the product could be divided, then the worker could buy this fractional part. The capitalist's profit would come not from overcharging the worker for this fractional part, but from the fact that in the whole of the product he sells a fractional part which he has not paid for, and which represents, precisely, *surplus labour time.* The product is always divisible as value; in its natural form, it need not be so. Profit here always comes from the fact that the whole value contains a fractional part which is not paid, and hence a fractional part of surplus labour is paid in each fractional part of the whole. So in the above example. When the capitalist sells 22 bushels, i.e. 2 which represent surplus labour, it is the same as if he sold an extra 1/10 of a bushel per bushel, i.e. 1/10 surplus value. If e.g. only one clock has been produced, where the relation of labour, capital and surplus value is the same, then the quality of the clock has been raised 1/10 in value by 1/10 labour time which costs the capitalist nothing.

Third case, that the capitalist, as is usual in manufacturing (but not in extractive industry), needs more raw material (let the instrument remain constant; however, nothing is changed if it, too, is variable) in which the surplus labour time objectifies itself. (Actually this does not belong here yet, for capital here can or []{#p428} must just as well be assumed as having also produced the raw material, e.g. the cotton, and surplus production at any point has to reduce itself to *mere* surplus labour, or, what is rather the *reality,* presupposes *simultaneous* surplus labour at all points of circulation.) Assume that he spins up 25 lb. of cotton, which cost him 50 thalers, and for which he requires machinery (which we will assume to be entirely consumed in the production process) at 30 thalers, and wages 20 thalers, for 25 lb. of twist, which he sells at 110. He sells each pound of twist, then, for 4 2/5 thalers, or 4 thalers 12 silver groschen. The worker thus obtains 4 6/11 lb. of twist, if he wants to buy it again. If the worker were working for himself, he would likewise sell the pound for 4 thalers 12 silver groschen and make no profit -- presupposing that he performs only the necessary labour; but he would spin up less cotton.

As we know, the value of a pound of twist consists exclusively of the amount of labour time objectified in it. Now suppose that the value of the pound of twist = 5 thalers. Given that 4/5, i.e. 4 thalers, represent cotton, instrument etc.; then 1 thaler represents the labour realized in the cotton by means of the instrument. If the worker, in order to live from spinning, needs say 20 thalers per month, then -- since he earns 1 thaler for spinning 1 lb. of twist, but needs 20 -- he would have to spin 20 lb. of twist. If he himself owned the cotton, material etc., and were working for himself, hence were his own master, then he would have to sell 20 lb. of twist; since he would earn only 1/5 on each, one thaler, and 1 Ã 20 = 20. If he works for the capitalist, then the labour which spins up 20 lb. of cotton only represents the necessary labour; for, by presupposition, of the 20 lb. of twist or 20 Ã 5 = 100 thalers, 80 thalers only represent the already purchased cotton and instrument, and the newly reproduced value represents nothing but *necessary labour.* Of the 20 lb. of twist, 4 lb. = 20 thalers would represent necessary labour, and 16 nothing more than the constant part of capital. 16 Ã 5 = 80 thalers. Each additional pound which the capitalist orders to be produced over and above the 20 contains 1/5 surplus labour, surplus value for him. (Objectified labour which he has sold without having paid for it.) If he orders 1 more pound spun, he gains 1 thaler; 10 lb, more, 10 thalers. Out of 10 lb. or 50 thalers, the capitalist would have 40 thalers to replace his investment and 10 thalers of surplus []{#p429} labour; or 8 lb. of twist with which to buy the material for 10 (machinery and cotton), and 2 lb. of twist, or their value, which have cost him nothing. If we now summarize the capitalist's accounts, we find that he has invested, in thalers

  Â                                                   Wages   Surplus value
  ----------- -------------------------------------- ------- ---------------
  80 + 40 =   120 (raw material, instrument, etc.)   20      10
  Â            120                                    20      10 = 150

Altogether he has produced 30 lb. of twist (30 Ã 5 = 150); the pound at 5 thalers, the exact *value* of the pound, i.e. purely determined by the labour objectified in it, and deriving value only from the latter. Of this 30 lb., 24 represent constant capital, 4 lb. go for wages, and 2 form the *surplus value*. Calculating it on the basis of his total investment, 140 thalers or 28 lb., as the capitalist himself does, this surplus value forms 1/14 = 7 1/7% (although, in the example given, the surplus value amounts to 50% on labour).

Now assume that the productivity of labour grows to the extent that he is capable of spinning 40 lb. with the same wage cost. According to our assumption he would sell these 40 lb. at their real value, i.e. the pound at 5 thalers, of which 4 thalers is labour objectified in cotton etc., 1 thaler is newly added labour. He would then sell:

40 lb. - the lb. @ 5 thalers = 40 Ã 5 = 200; from these 40 lb., deduct

On an investment of 200 thalers the capitalist would have earned 20, or 10%. 10% on total investment; but in fact 20 on the second hundred thalers or second 20 lb., in which he did not pay the objectified labour. Now assume that he is capable of making double that, say

In fact in the above example the capitalist's investment is only 180; on this he makes 20, or 11 1/9%.

The smaller the part of the outlay becomes which represents necessary labour, the greater the gain, although it stands in no obvious relation to the real surplus value, i.e. surplus labour. For example. In order for the capitalist to gain 10%, he has to spin 40 lb. of twist; the worker needs to spin only 20 = necessary labour. Surplus labour = necessary labour, 100% surplus value. This is our old law. But this is not the matter at issue here.

In the above example with the 40 lb., the *real value* of the pound is 5 thalers, and, like the capitalist, the worker himself, if he conducted his own business *as a worker* (and could advance himself enough funds to be able to realize the raw material etc. to the extent necessary to allow him to live as a worker), would sell the pound at 5 thalers. He would, however, produce only 20 lb., and from its sale he would use 4/5 to obtain new raw material, and 1/5 to live. The only thing he would make out of the 100 thalers would be his wages. The capitalist's gain comes not from selling the pound *too dear* -- he sells it at its *exact value* -- but from selling it above the *costs of production, his costs* (not *the* costs, for the 1/5 costs the worker surplus labour). If he sold at less than 5 thalers, he would be selling *below* the value, and the buyer would have the 1/5 of labour contained in every pound of twist above the investment etc., for nothing. But the capitalist calculates in this manner:

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Value of 1 pound =    | 5                                                                        | thalers                             |

What he calculates is not that he gains 20 thalers out of the second 100 thalers, but that he gains 20 on his entire investment of ... []{#p431} 180 thalers. This gives him a profit of 11 1/9%, instead of 20. He calculates further that, in order to make this profit, he has to sell 40 lb. 40 lb. at 5 thalers gives him not 1/5, or 20%, but 20 thalers distributed over 40 lb., or 1/2 a thaler per pound. At the price for which he sells the pound, he makes 1/2 a thaler out of 5 thalers; or 1 out of 10 thalers; 10% of the selling price. The price is determined by the price of the fractional unit (1 pound) multiplied by the number to be sold; here 1 pound at 5 thalers Ã 40. While this determination of price is correct for the capitalist's pocket, it is equally liable to lead one astray theoretically, in as much as it now seems as if an overcharge above the *real* value took place in each individual pound, and the origin of the surplus value in each individual pound has become invisible. This *determination of price by the multiplication of the value of the unit (measure) of the use value (pound, yard, ton etc.) with the number of these units produced* is important later in the theory of prices. There follows from it among other things that a decline in the price of the unit and an increase in the number of units -- brought about by growth of the productive forces -- shows that profit increases in relation with labour, or that the proportion \[*VerhÃ¤ltnis*\] of necessary labour declines in relation \[*im VerhÃ¤ltnis*\] to surplus labour -- and not the opposite, as is the opinion of Mr Bastiat etc.[^45] E.g. if labour grew, owing to productivity, to the point where the worker was producing twice as many pounds in the same time as before -- presupposing that 1 lb. of twist renders him entirely the same service, regardless of its cost, and that twist, clothing, is all he needs to live -- then the value added by labour to 20 lb. of twist would no longer amount to 1/5 but now only to 1/10, because he would be transforming the 20 lb. cotton into twist in 1/2 the time. To the 80 thalers which the raw material cost, there would then be added not 20 thalers but only 10. The 20 lb. would cost 90 thalers and each pound 90/20 or 4 10/20 thalers. But if the total labour time remained the same, then labour would now transform 80 lb. of cotton into twist, instead of 40. 80 lb. twist, the pound at 4 9/20 thalers, = 356 thalers.[^46] The capitalist's account would be -- []{#p432}

  ------------------ ----------------- ----------------- -------------------------------------------------

The capitalist's gain from the value of the measure (unit) of use value -- pound, yard, quarter etc. -- decreases in proportion as the relation of living labour to raw material etc. -- of newly added labour -- decreases; i.e. the less labour time is necessary to give the raw material the form which the unit expresses. Yard of cloth etc. But on the other side, -- since this identical with the increased productivity of labour, or the growth of surplus labour time -- the number of these units grows, units in which surplus labour time is contained, i.e. labour time not paid for.

It further follows from the above that the price can fall *below* the value, and capital can still make a gain; he must sell, however, a number multiplied by the unit large enough to form a surplus over the number multiplied by the unit which forms the necessary price of labour. If the relation of labour to raw material etc. is 1/5, then he can sell at e.g. only 1/10 above the constant value, since the surplus labour *costs* him *nothing.* He then makes a present of 1/10 of the surplus labour to the consumer and realizes only 1/10 for himself. This very important in competition; overlooked in particular by Ricardo. The determination of prices is founded on the determination of values, but new elements enter in. The price, which originally appeared only as the value expressed in money, becomes further determined as itself a specific magnitude. If 5 thalers is the *value* of a pound of twist, i.e. the same labour time as is contained in 5 thalers is contained in 1 pound of twist, then this remains its value regardless of whether 4 or 4 million lb. of twist are being appraised. The moment of the NUMBER OF POUNDS, because it expresses the relation of surplus labour to necessary labour in another form, becomes decisively important in the *determination of price.* This matter brought to popular awareness in the question of the *ten hours' bill* etc. []{#p433}

##### Specific accumulation *of capital (transformation of surplus labour (revenue) into capital). -- Proudhon. Value- and price- determination. In antiquity (slaves) not overproduction but over-consumption*

It follows further from the above:

If the worker were to restrict himself to *necessary labour,* he would spin no more than 20 lb. of twist, and realize no more raw material, machinery etc. than would have a value of 80 thalers monthly. Apart from the raw material, machinery etc. which are required for the workers *reproduction,* self-maintenance, the capitalist must *necessarily* lay out capital in raw material (and machinery, even if not in the same proportion) for the objectification of surplus labour. (In agriculture, fishery, in short, the extractive industries, this is not absolutely necessary; it becomes so, however, when they are conducted on a large scale, i.e. *industrially;* it appears then as surplus outlay not in raw material itself, but in the instruments to take it out with.) These surplus outlays -- i.e. the tendering of the material for surplus labour -- of the objective elements of its realization \[*Verwirklichung*\] are actually what forms the specific so-called *provisional accumulation* of capital: the accumulation of the stock (let us say for the time being) *specifically* of capital. For it is stupid, as we shall see more closely, to regard it as a quality specific to capital -- that the objective conditions of living labour must be present, as such -- whether they are furnished by nature or produced in history. These *specific advances* which capital makes signify nothing more than that it *realizes* objectified surplus labour -- surplus product -- in new living surplus labour, instead of investing (spending) it, like, say, Egyptian kings or Etruscan priest-nobles for pyramids etc.

Into the *determination of prices* (as we shall also see with profit) there also enters -- *fraud, reciprocal chicanery.* One party can win in exchange what the other loses; all they can distribute among themselves is the surplus value -- capital as a class. But these proportions open a field for individual deception etc. (apart from supply and demand) which has nothing to do with the determination of value as such.

Thus, out the window goes Mr Proudhon's discovery that the worker cannot buy back his product. The basis on which this rests is that he (Proudhon) understands nothing, either about value-determination or about price-determination. But, furthermore and regardless of that, his conclusion that *this is why* there is over []{#p434} production is false in this abstraction. In the slave relation, the masters are not troubled by the fact that the workers do not compete with them as consumers. (Nevertheless, *production for luxury* as it presents itself in antiquity is a necessary result of the slave relation. Not overproduction, but *over-consumption* and *insane consumption,* signifying, by its turn towards the monstrous and the bizarre, the downfall of the old system of states.)

After capital steps out of the production process as *product,* it must be transformed into money again. The money which previously appeared merely as realized commodity etc., now appears as *realized capital,* or, realized capital as *money.* This an aspect of *money* (as of capital). The mass of money as medium of circulation has nothing to do with the difficulty of making capital into a reality \[*realisieren\],* i.e. of realizing it \[*verwerten\].* This can already be seen from the above development.

##### *The general rate of profit. -- If the capitalist merely sells at* his own *cost of production, then it is a* transfer *to another capitalist. Worker gains almost nothing thereby*

In the above example, where the capitalist, if he sells the pound of twist at 5 thalers -- i.e. 40 lb. at 5 thalers each -- hence sells the pound of twist at its *real value* and thereby gains 1/2 a thaler out of 5 (the selling price), 10% on the selling price, or 1/2 on 4 1/2, i.e. 11 1/9% of his outlay, if he sells at only 10% -- assume now a profit of merely 9/20 of a thaler on 4 1/2 thalers (this is a 1/20 difference from 1/2 on 4 1/2 thalers; a difference of just 1 1/9%). He then sells the pound at 4 1/2 thalers + 9/20 of a thaler; i.e. at 4 19/20 thalers or the 40 lb. at 198 thalers. Now various cases are possible. The capitalist with whom he exchanges -- to whom he sells his 40 lb. -- assume him to be the owner of a silver mine, i.e. silver producer -- pays him only 198 thalers -- hence gives him 2 thalers too little objectified labour in silver for the labour objectified in 40 lb. of cotton. Posit that with this capitalist B, the proportions of the outlay are exactly the same, etc. If capitalist B also takes only 10 instead of 11 1/9, then for 200 thalers he could not demand 40 lb. twist, but only 39 3/5. It is therefore impossible that both capitalists at the same time sell at 1 1/9% too little, or that the one offered 40 lb. for 198 thalers and the other offered 200 thalers for 39 3/5 lb., a case that cannot occur. In the previously assumed case, capitalist B would have paid 1 1/9% too little in his purchase of 40 lb. twist, i.e. apart from the profit []{#p435} which he does not obtain from exchange, but which exchange merely confirms, i.e. a profit of 11 1/9, he would also have gained the 1 1/9% lost by the other capitalist, for a total of 12 2/9%. From his own workers -- the labour set into motion by his own capital -- he would have gained 11 1/9%; the additional 1 1/9% are surplus labour by the workers of capitalist A, which he appropriates for himself. The *general rate of profit* can therefore fall in one or another branch of business if competition etc. forces the capitalist to sell below the *value,* i.e. to realize a part of the surplus labour not for himself, but for those who buy from him. But the general rate cannot fall in this way; it can fall only if the proportion of surplus labour to necessary labour falls *relatively,* and this, as we saw earlier, takes place if the proportion is already very large, or, expressed differently, if the proportion of living labour set into motion by capital is very small -- if the part of capital which exchanges for living labour is very small compared to that which exchanges for machinery and raw material. The general rate of profit can fall in that case, even though absolute surplus labour rises.

With that, we come to another point. A *general rate of profit* as such is possible only if the rate of profit in one branch of business is too high and in another too low; i.e. that a part of the surplus value -- which corresponds to surplus labour -- is transferred from one capitalist to the other. If in 5 branches of business, for example, the respective rate of profit is

  ------- ------- ------- ------- -------
  **A**   **B**   **C**   **D**   **E**
  15%,    12%,    10%,    8%,     5%
  ------- ------- ------- ------- -------

then the average rate is 10%; but, in order for this to exist in reality, capitalist A and B have to give up 7% to D and E -- more particularly, 2 to D and 5 to E -- while C remains as it was. It is impossible for rates of profit on the same capital of 100 to be equal, since the relations of surplus labour are altogether different, depending on the productivity of labour and on the relation between raw material, machinery and wages, and on the overall volume in which production takes place. But suppose that a given branch of business, E, is necessary, say, the bakery trade, then the average 10% has to be paid to it. But this can happen only if A and B credit E with a part of their surplus labour. The capitalist class thus to a certain extent distributes the total surplus value so that, to a certain degree, it \[shares in it\] evenly in accordance with the *size* of its capital, instead of in accordance with the surplus values []{#p436}actually created by the capitals in the various branches of business. The larger profit -- arising from the real surplus labour within a branch of production, the really created surplus value -- is pushed down to the average level by competition, and the deficit of surplus value in the other branch of business raised up to the average level by withdrawal of capitals from it, i.e. a favourable relation of demand and supply. Competition cannot lower this level itself, but merely has the tendency to create such a level. Further developments belong in the section on competition. This is realized \[*realisiert*\] by means of the relation of prices in the different branches of business, which fall *below* the *value* in some, rise *above* it in others. This makes it seem as if an equal sum of capital in unequal branches of business created *equal surplus labour or surplus value.*

Now in the above example, where capitalist A is forced, say by competition, to sell at a profit of 10% instead of 11 1/9%, and hence sells the pound of twist at 1/20 of a thaler too cheaply, the worker would continue to obtain 20 thalers as before, in money, his necessary wages; but in twist, he would obtain 4 4/90 lb. instead of 4 lb. If his wages were in twist, he would have obtained 4/20 of a thaler = 1/5 of a thaler or 6 silver groschen, i.e. 1% more than his necessary wages. If the worker works in a branch of business whose product lies entirely outside the sphere of his consumption, then he gains not a farthing in this operation; rather, for him it is a matter of performing a part of his surplus labour indirectly for capitalist B, instead of directly for capitalist A; i.e. through the mediation of capitalist A. He can gain from the fact that capitalist A lets go of a part of the labour objectified in his product for nothing, only if he is himself a consumer of this product, and only to the extent that he is such a consumer. Thus, if his consumption of twist makes up 1/10 of his expenditure, then he gains exactly 1/50 of a thaler from the operation (2/100 of a thaler out of 2 thalers, 1/100 of 1, exactly 1% of the 2 thalers), i.e. 1/10% of his total wages of 20 thalers, or, 7 1/5 pfennigs. This would be the proportion -- 7 1/5 pfennigs -- in which he would participate in his own surplus labour of 20 thalers. Such are the proportions of the surplus wages which the worker makes at best, when the *price* in the branch of business where he is occupied falls below the necessary value. In the *best case* -- and this is impossible -- the limit (in the instance given) is 6 silver groschen or 1%, i.e. if he could live exclusively on twist; i.e. in the best case his surplus wages are []{#p437} determined by the relation of necessary labour time to surplus labour time. In the luxury-goods industries proper, from whose consumption he is himself excluded, it is always = 0.

Now let us assume that capitalists A, B, C exchange among one another; the total product of each = 200 thalers. Let A produce twist, B grain and C silver; let the relations of surplus and necessary labour, and of outlays and profit be just the same. A sells 40 lb. twist at 198, instead of at 200 thalers, and loses 1 1/9% of his gains; ditto B his, say 40 bushels wheat, at 198 instead of 200; but C exchanges the labour objectified in his 200 thalers in full. Between A and B the relation is such that neither of them loses in the exchange with the other. A would obtain 40 bushels wheat, B 40 lb. twist; but each of them a value of only 198. C obtains 40 lb. twist or 40 bushels wheat for 198 thalers and in both cases pays 2 thalers too little, or obtains 2/3 lb. twist or 2/5 bushel wheat too much. But now assume that the relation takes the form that A sells his 40 lb. to the silver man, C, for 200 thalers, but C has to pay 202 to the grain man, B, or 2 thalers above its value. Between twist A and silver C everything is all right; both exchange at value with each other; but because B's price has risen above its value, the 40 lb. twist and the 200 thalers silver, when expressed in grain, have fallen by 1 1/9%, or, neither of them could in fact any longer buy 40 bushels grain for 200 thalers, but only 39 2/5. 39 2/5 bushels wheat would cost 200 thalers, or the single bushel wheat,[^47] instead of 5 thalers, 5 1/20 thalers; 5 thalers 1 1/4 silver groschen. Now, in this last relation, assume that the worker's consumption consists 1/2 of wheat; his twist consumption was 1/10 of his income; his wheat consumption 5/10. On the 1/10 he had gained 1/10% on his total wages; on the wheat, he loses 5/10; thus on the whole he loses 4/10% instead of gaining. Although the capitalist would have paid him his necessary labour, his wages would fall beneath the necessary pay as a consequence of grain man B's overcharging. If this continued on, then his necessary *wages* would have to *rise.* Thus if the sale of twist by capitalist A is due to a rise above value in the price of *grain* or of other use values which form the most essential part of the worker's consumption -- then capitalist A's worker would lose in the same relation as his consumption of the now more expensive product is greater than the cheaper product he himself produces. But if A had sold twist at 1 1/9% above its value, and B sold grain at 1 1/9% below, []{#p438} then, in the best case, if the worker consumed nothing but grain, he could gain at most 6 silver groschen, or, since we presupposed half in grain, only 3 silver groschen, or 3% on his wages of 20 thalers. Thus the worker may experience all three cases: his gain or loss from the operation = 0; it may depreciate his necessary wages, so that they no longer suffice, hence make him fall below the necessary minimum; it can thirdly bring him a surplus wage, which is resolved into a very small share of his own surplus labour.

We saw above that if the relation of necessary labour to the other conditions of production = 2/5 (20 out of 100 total outlay) or = 40% of the total value (in 20 lb. twist = 4 lb. twist) (or of 100 thalers, 80 raw material and instrument, 20 labour) and the relation of surplus labour to necessary labour is 100% (i.e. the same quantity), then the capitalist makes 11 1/9% on his outlay.

If he took only 10% and made a gift of the 1 1/9 or 2 thalers (transferred surplus value), then the worker, in so far as he is a consumer, would likewise gain, and in the best (impossible) case, if he lived only from the products of his master, it would \[be\], as we saw:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Suppose the capitalist sold the pound of twist at 4 15/20 (4 3/4) instead of at 5 thalers, then the worker would gain 5/20 on the pound, and 20/20 = 1 on 4 lb.; but 1 out of 20 = 1/20 = 5% (1 thaler out of 20); the capitalist would sell the 40 lb. at 4 15/20 thalers = 95/20 of a thaler Ã 40 = 190 thalers; his outlays 180, his gain = 10 = 5 6/9\[%\], his minus-gain = 5 6/9; if he, the capitalist, sold at 4 12/20, then the worker would gain 8/20 thalers per pound, 32/20 per 4 lb., 1 thaler 12/20 or 1 3/5 thalers on his total wages, i.e. 8 48/119%, while the capitalist would lose 16 thalers of the surplus gain, or would only keep altogether 184 thalers, or 4 thalers gain on 180 = 1/45 of 180 = 2 2/9%; would lose 8 8/9; assume finally the capitalist sold the pound of twist at 4 1/2 thalers; the 40 lb. at 180; his profit = 0; he would make the consumer a present of the worker's surplus value or surplus labour time, then the worker's gain = 1/2 of a thaler per lb., = 4/2 of a thaler = 2 thalers, or 2 thalers out of 20 = 10%.   1 1/9% loss on the capitalist's side:=   1% = 6 silver groschen on 20 thalers (= 1/5 of a thaler out of 20) gain above wages for the worker: = 1 thaler

If on the other hand the capitalist had raised wages by 10% from 20 to 22 thalers, because, say, the demand for labour in his branch of business had risen above the supply -- while he continued to sell the pound of twist at its value, i.e. at 5 thalers as before, then his profit would have fallen by only 2 thalers, from 200 to 198, i.e. by 1 1/9%, and would still have been 10%.

It follows from this that if the capitalist, say, out of consideration for Mr Proudhon, sold his commodities at the production costs they cost *him,* and if his total profit = 0, this would be merely a transfer of the surplus value or surplus labour time from capitalist A to B, C, D etc., and as regards his worker, his gain at best -- i.e. his share of his own surplus labour -- would be limited to that part of the wage which he consumed in the depreciated commodity; and if he spent his entire wages on it, the gain could not be greater than the proportion of necessary labour to the total product (in the above example 20: 200 = 1/10, 1/10 of 20 = 2 thalers). As regards the other workers, the case is entirely the same; they gain from the depreciated commodity only in relation (1) as they consume it; (2) relative to the size of their wage, which is determined by necessary labour. If the depreciated commodity were, e.g. grain -- one of the staffs of life -- then first its producer, the farmer, and following him all other capitalists, would make the discovery that the worker's necessary wage is no longer the necessary wage; but stands above its level; hence it is brought down; hence ultimately only the surplus value of capitals A, B, C etc. is increased, and the surplus labour of those occupied in them.

Posit 5 capitalists, A, B, C, D and E. Let E produce a commodity which is consumed only by workers. E would then realize his profit purely in the exchange of his commodity with wages; but, as always, his profit would originate not in the exchange of his commodity for the workers' money, but in the exchange of his capital with living labour. Posit that necessary labour relates in all 5 branches of business at 1/5; let 1/5 be surplus labour in all of them; let constant capital be = 3/5 in all. Capitalist E exchanges his product for 1/5 of capital A, 1/5 of capital B, 1/5 of capital C, 1/5 of capital D, and 1/5 constitutes his wages. He would make no profit on this last 1/5, as we have seen; or rather his profit would not arise from the fact that he gives the workers 1/5 of his capital in money, and that they buy back the same 1/5 from him as money -- would not originate from the exchange with them as *consumers,* as centres of circulation. []{#p440} His whole transaction with them as consumers rests on the basis that he gives them his product in the form of money, and they give him back the same money for exactly the same fractional part of the product. With the workers of A, B, C, D, his relation is not that of capitalist to worker, but of C\[ommodity\] to M\[oney\], of vendor to buyer. We have presupposed that the workers of A, B, C, D consume no part of their own products; D does, however, exchange for 1/5 of the product of A, B, C and E, i.e. 4/5 of their product; but this exchange is only a detour to get to the wages which A, B, C and D pay their own workers. They each give the workers money to the value of 1/5 of their product, or 1/5 of their product as payment for necessary labour, and with this, with 4/5 of the value of their product or capital, they then buy E's commodity. But this exchange with E is then only an indirect form of advancing the part of capital which represents necessary labour -- i.e. *deduction* from their capital. They cannot therefore gain thereby. The gain comes from the realization of the remaining 4/5 of capital A, B, C, D, and this realization consists of each of them, through the exchange, getting back the labour objectified in his product, in another form. For each of them, since there is a division of labour, 3/5 replaces his constant capital, raw material and material of labour. Their gain -- the realization of surplus labour time, its positing as surplus value -- consists in the reciprocal realization of the last 1/5. It is not necessary that capitals A, B, C, D exchange the entire 4/5 with one another. Since they are, as capitalists, at the same time large consumers, and can in no way live on air, but since, as capitalists, they do not live from their labour either, they have nothing to exchange or to consume apart from other peoples' products. That is, for their own consumption they exchange just that 1/5 which represents surplus labour time, the labour created by means of capital. Posit that each consumes 1/5 of this 1/5, i.e. 1/25, in the form of his own product. There remain 4/25 to be either realized or to be transformed into use values for their own consumption through exchange. Let A exchange 2/25 with B, 1/25 with C, 1/25 with E, and likewise on the part of B, C, E.

The case we have posited, where capital E realizes the whole of its profit in exchange with wages, is the most favourable -- or expresses, rather, the only correct relation in which it is possible for capital to realize the surplus value created in *production* through *exchange* with the workers' consumption. But capitals A, B, C, D can realize their value in this case only through exchange among []{#p441} one another, i.e. through the exchange of capitalists among themselves. Capitalist E consumes nothing of his own commodity, since he has paid 1/5 of it to his own workers, exchanged 1/5 for 1/5 of capital A, 1/5 for 1/5 of capital B, 1/5 for 1/5 of capital C, 1/5 for 1/5 of capital D. A, B, C, D make no profit on this exchange, since it is the respective 1/5 which they have paid to their own workers.

Given the relation we have assumed, of 2/5 raw material, 1/5 machinery, 1/5 workers' necessaries, and 1/5 surplus product, from which Messrs the capitalists at the same time live and realize their surplus value, then we need, if the total product of each of A, B, C, D, E = 100, a producer E for workers' necessaries, 2 capitalists A and B, who produce raw materials for all the others, 1, C, who produces the machinery, and 1, D, who makes the surplus produce, The accounts would be these (the machinery-maker etc. has to produce every part of his commodity for himself):

E therefore exchanges his entire product of 100 for 20 in his own workers' wages, 20 in wages for workers of raw material A, 20 for the workers of raw material B, 20 for the workers of machinery maker C, 20 for the workers of surplus producer D; of this he exchanges 40 for raw material, 20 for machinery, 20 he obtains back for workers' necessaries, and 20 remain for him to buy surplus produce, from which he himself lives. Likewise the others in the relation. What constitutes their surplus value is the 1/5 or 20, which all of them can exchange for surplus product. If they consumed the entire surplus, then they would have come no further at the end than they were at the beginning, and the surplus value of their capital would not grow. Posit that they eat up only 10; or 1/10, half []{#p442}of the surplus value; then surplus producer D himself would eat up 10 less; and each of the others 10 less; all in all, then, he would sell only half of his commodity, = 50, and could not begin his business anew. Posit therefore that he consumes only 50 in consumables. Likewise, 50 in money, then each of the capitalists A, B, C, D, E, would accumulate 10 thalers in money. These would represent the surplus value not consumed. These 10 thalers, or together 50, could be realized, however, only by being laid out for new labour. In order to produce more raw material, A and B need 4 thalers more of living labour, and, since they have no additional machinery for it, more labour by hand to the amount of 6 thalers. Thus, out of the 400 thalers which exist in raw materials, machines and workers' necessaries, only 50 are there for capitalists' consumables. But each of the capitalists now owns a surplus of 10, out of which 4 are in raw material, 2 in machines, 2 in workers' necessaries, on which he must make a gain of 2 (like 100 from 80, as before); D has gained 10 on his 40 and can therefore increase his production in the same proportion, i.e. by 5. The next year he produces 7 1/2% more = 57 1/2.

This example may or may not be continued later. Does not actually belong here. This much is clear, that realization here takes place in the exchange among the capitalists, for although E produces only for workers' consumption, he exchanges with the others through the form of wages, 1/5 of A, 1/5 of B, 1/5 of C, 1/5 of D etc. A, B, C, D likewise exchange with E: not directly, but indirectly, in that each of them requires 1/5 from him as necessaries for his workers. The realization consists of each of them exchanging his own product for fractional parts of the products of the other four, and this in such a way that a part of the surplus product goes for the capitalist's own consumption, and a part is transformed into surplus capital with which to set new labour into motion. The realization consists of the *real possibility* of increased realization -- production of new and larger values. It is clear here that D and E, where E represents all commodities consumed by the workers and D all those consumed by the capitalists, would have produced too much -- that is, too much relative to the proportion of the part of capital going to the worker, or too much relative to the part of capital consumable by the capitalists (too much relative to the proportion by which they must increase their capital; and this proportion later obtains a minimum limit in the form of interest) -- that *general overproduction* would take place, not because relatively *too little* []{#p443} \[sic\] had been produced of the commodities consumed by the workers or too little \[sic\] of those consumed by the capitalists, but because too much *of both* had been produced -- *not* too much *for consumption,* but too much to retain *the correct relation between consumption and realization; too much for realization.*

##### *Barrier of capitalist production. -- Relation of surplus labour to necessary labour. Proportion of the surplus consumed by capital to that transformed into capital. -- Devaluation during crises*

In other words: At a given point in the development of the productive forces -- for this will determine the relation of necessary labour to surplus labour -- a fixed relation becomes established, in which the product is divided into one part -- corresponding to raw material, machinery, necessary labour, surplus labour -- and finally surplus labour divides into one part which goes to consumption and another which becomes capital again. This inner division, inherent in the concept of capital, appears in exchange in such a way that the exchange of the capitals among one another takes place in specific and restricted proportions -- even if these are constantly changing, in the course of production. If the relations are e.g. those of 2/5 raw material, 1/5 machinery, 1/5 wages, 1/5 surplus product, of which 1/10 for consumption, 1/10 for new production -- this is the division within capital -- this will appear in the exchange process as distribution among, say, 5 capitals. This gives, in any case, both the sum total of the exchange which can take place, and the proportions in which each of these capitals must both exchange and produce. If the relation of necessary labour to the constant part of capital is, as e.g. in the above example, = 1/5:3/5, then we have seen that the capital which works for the consumption of capitalists and workers combined may not be greater than 1/5 + 1/10 of the 5 capitals, each of which represents 1, = 1 1/2 capitals. Given likewise is the relation in which each capital must exchange with each other one, which represents a specific one of its own moments. Finally, in which each of them must exchange at all. If, for example, the relation of raw material = 2/5, then the capitals which produce raw material can at any final point exchange no more than 3/5, while 2/5 must be regarded as fixed. (E.g. as seed etc. in agriculture.) *Exchange* in and for itself gives these conceptually opposite moments an indifferent being; they exist independently of one another; their []{#p444} inner necessity becomes *manifest* in the crisis, which puts a forcible end to their seeming indifference towards each other.

A revolution in the forces of production further alters these relations, *changes* these relations themselves, whose foundations -- from the standpoint of capital and hence also of that of realization through exchange -- always remains *the relation of necessary to surplus labour,* or, if you like, of the different moments of objectified to living labour. It is possible, as we have already indicated earlier, that the capital as well as the living labour capacity set free owing to the increase in productive forces must both lie dormant, because they are not present in the proportions in which production must take place on the basis of the newly developed productive forces. If it proceeds regardless of that, then ultimately a minus, a negative magnitude, will come out of the exchange on one side or the other.

The barrier always remains, that exchange -- hence production as well -- takes place in such a way that the relation of surplus labour to necessary labour remains the same -- for this is = to the constancy \[*Gleichbleiben*\] of the realization of capital. The second relation -- the proportion between the part of the surplus product consumed by capital and that part transformed anew into capital -- is determined by the first relation. Firstly, *the magnitude of the sum to be divided into these two parts depends on this original relation;* secondly, just as the creation of surplus value by capital depends on the creation of surplus labour, so does the increase of capital as capital (accumulation, and, without accumulation, capital cannot form the foundation of production, since it would remain stagnant, and would not be an element of progress, required already by the mere increase of population etc.) depend on the transformation of a part of this surplus product into new capital. If the surplus value were simply consumed, then capital would *not* have realized itself as capital, and not produced itself as *capital,* i.e. as value which produces value.

We have seen that if 40 lb. of twist of a value of 200 thalers -- because they contain labour time objectified in 200 thalers -- are exchanged for 198 thalers, then not only does the manufacturer of twist lose 1 1/9% gain; but also his product is devalued, has been sold *below* its real value, although it is sold at a *price* which still leaves him a profit of 10%. On the other hand, the producer of silver gains 2 thalers. Keeps 2 thalers as liberated capital. Nevertheless, a devaluation has taken place as regards the total sum. For the sum []{#p445} is 398 thalers instead of 400. For, in the hand of the producer of silver, the 200 thalers of twist are also worth only 198; it is the same for him as if the productive force of his labour had increased to the point where the same objectified labour were contained in 200 thalers as before, but that 2 of these thalers had left the column of necessary outlays in his books and gone over into the column of surplus value, so that he would have paid 2 thalers less for necessary labour. The opposite could be the case only if the silver producer were able to re-sell for 200 thalers the 40 lb. of twist he bought at 198 thalers. Then he would have 202 thalers, and say he sold them to a manufacturer of silk who gave him silk to the value of 200 thalers in exchange for the 40 lb. of twist. The 40 lb. twist would then have been sold at their true value, although not first-hand by their producer, but rather second-hand, by their buyer, and the total accounts would look as follows: Exchanged, 3 products each containing objectified labour of a value of 200 thalers; hence *sum* of the values of the capitals: 600. The manufacturer of twist, A, the manufacturer of silver, B, the manufacturer of silk, C: A 198, B 202 (i.e. 2 extra from the first exchange and 200 in silk), C 200. *Total* 600. In this case the combined value of the capitals remained the same, and all that took place was a displacement, in that B pocketed as an extra the value-fraction which A lost.

If A, the twist maker, could sell only 180 (the cost of the thing for *him*), and absolutely could not find a buyer for 20 twist, then objectified labour in the amount of 20 thalers would have become valueless. The same would be the case if he gave a value of 200 for 180 thalers; for B, the manufacturer of silver -- to the extent that this necessity had arisen for A owing to overproduction of twist, so that B, too, could not get rid of the value contained in the 40 lb. twist for more than 180 -- 20 thalers of his capital would have been set free. He would have in hand a relative surplus value of 20 thalers, but in absolute values -- objectified labour time to the extent that it is exchangeable -- he would have only 200 as before -- that is, 40 lb. twist at 180 and 20 thalers liberated capital. It would be the same for him as if the production costs of twist had decreased, i.e. as if, owing to increased labour productivity, 40 lb. twist contained 20 thalers less labour time, or as if, with a working day = 4 thalers, 5 working days less were necessary in order to transform *x* lb. of cotton into 40 lb. twist; so that, then, he would have to exchange less labour time objectified in silver for the labour []{#p446} time objectified in twist. But the combined sum of the values on hand would be 380 instead of 400. Thus a *general depreciation* of 20 thalers would have taken place, or a destruction of capital to the amount of 20 thalers. A *general devaluation* thus takes place despite the fact that the *depreciation* of the twist manufacturer's 40 lb. twist from 200 to 180 necessarily appears as an appreciation on the part of silver, a depreciation of twist relative to silver; and a general depreciation of prices as such always includes an appreciation of money, i.e. of the commodity in which all the others are appraised. Thus, in a crisis -- a general depreciation of prices -- there occurs up to a certain moment a *general devaluation* or *destruction of capital.* The devaluation, like the *depreciation,* can be absolute and not merely relative, because value expresses not merely a relation between one commodity and another, as does price, but rather the relation between the price of the commodity and the labour objectified in it, or between one amount of objectified labour of the same quality and another. If these amounts are not equal, then *devaluation* takes place, which is not outweighed by appreciation on the other side, for the other side expresses a fixed amount of objectified labour which remains unchanged by exchange. In general crises, this devaluation extends even to living labour capacity itself. In consequence of what has been indicated above, the destruction of value and capital which takes place in a crisis coincides with -- or means the same thing as -- a general growth of the *productive forces,* which, however, takes place not by means of a real increase of the productive force of labour (the extent to which this happens in consequence of crises is beside the point here), but by means of a decrease of the existing value of raw materials, machines, labour capacity. For example. The cotton manufacturer loses capital on his products (e.g. twist), but he buys the same value of cotton, labour etc. at a lower price. It is the same for him as if the *real value* of labour, of cotton etc., had decreased, i.e. as if they had been produced more cheaply owing to an increase in the productive force of labour. In the same way, on the other hand, a sudden general increase in the forces of production would relatively devalue all the *present values* which labour objectifies at the lower stage of the productive forces, and hence would destroy present capital as well as present labouring capacity. The other side of the crisis resolves itself into a real decrease in production, in living labour -- in order to restore the correct relation between necessary and surplus labour, on which, in the last analysis, everything rests. []{#p447} (Thus it is by no means true, as Lord Overstone thinks -- as a true usurer -- that crises simply resolve themselves in enormous profits for the one, and tremendous losses for the other.)[^48]

##### *Capital coming out of the production process becomes money again*

Exchange does not change the inner characteristics of realization; but it projects them to the outside; gives them a reciprocally independent form, and thereby lets their unity exist merely as an inner necessity, which must therefore come forcibly to the surface in crises. Both are therefore posited in the essence of capital: the devaluation \[*Entwertung*\] of capital in the production process, as well as the suspension of devaluation and the creation of the conditions for the realization \[*Verwertung*\] of capital. The process by which this takes place in reality can be examined only as soon as *real* capital, i.e. competition etc. -- the actual real conditions -- have been examined. Does not belong here yet. On the other hand, *without* exchange the production of capital as such would not exist, since *realization* as such cannot exist without exchange. Without exchange, the only question of concern would be the measurement etc. of the *use value* produced, only use value as such.

After capital, in the production process, (1) has realized itself, i.e. created a new value; (2) become devalued, i.e. made the transition from money to the form of a particular commodity, it (3) realizes itself together with its new value, in that the product is thrown into circulation again, and, as C, is exchanged for M. At the point where we stand now, where capital is being examined only in general, the real difficulties of this third process are present only as *possibilities,* and are therefore suspended, again as *possibilities.* Therefore, the product now posited as having been transformed back into money.

Capital is thus now posited as money again, and money therefore posited in the *new* aspect of *realized capital,* not merely as realized price of the commodity. Or, the commodity realized in the price is []{#p448} now realized capital. We will examine this new aspect of money, or rather of capital as money, later. In accord with the initial nature of money, the only apparent feature by which capital -- when transformed into money -- may be measured is the new value which it has created; i.e. the first aspect of money as the general measure of commodities repeats itself; now as the measure of surplus value -- of the realization of capital. In the form of money, this realization appears as measured by itself; as being its own measure. The capital was originally 100 thalers; because it is now 110, the measure of its realization is posited in its own form -- as a proportion of the capital returned (returned to its money form) from the production process and from exchange, relative to the original capital; no longer as a relation between two unequal qualities -- objectified and living labour -- or necessary labour and surplus labour. When capital is posited as money, it is therefore posited in the first aspect of money, as measure of value. Here, however, this value is its own value, or the measure of its self, negation.[^49] We will return to this (under profit).

The second form of money was that of the medium of circulation, and in this regard the money form of capital appeared as a mere vanishing moment for the purpose of exchanging it again, but not, as in the case of money as a medium of circulation in general, an exchange in return for commodities -- use values -- for final consumption, but rather an exchange in return for those particular use values in which it is able to begin its course as capital anew -- raw material and instrument on the one hand, living labour capacity on the other. In this role it is *circulating capital,* about which later. However, the end-product of money in its role as medium of circulation is the beginning of the act of production with *posited* capital as the point of departure, and this is the point which we will here examine before we go further. (In the first aspect, *measure,* the *new value* did appear as measured; but the difference merely formal; instead of surplus labour, money -- surplus labour objectified in a specific commodity. But the *qualitative* nature of this new value also undergoes a change -- i.e. the magnitude of the measure itself, to be examined only later. Secondly, as medium of circulation the disappearance of the money form is also merely *formal.* It only becomes *essential* after not only the first but also the second circular path has been completed. Thus initially it results only in []{#p449} our standing again at the beginning of the *realization process.* We therefore begin to take up the continuation at *this point.*)

The third form of money, as independent value in a negative relation *vis-Ã -vis* circulation, is capital which does not step out of the production process into exchange again to become money. Rather, it is capital which becomes a commodity and enters into circulation in the form of self-sufficient value \[*sich auf sich selbst beziehenden Werts*\]. This third form presupposes capital in the earlier forms and at the same time forms the transition from *capital* to the *particular capitals,* the real capitals; since now, in this last form, capital already in its very concept divides into two capitals with an independent existence. Along with the duality, plurality in general is then given. Such is the march of this development.[^50]

\<Before we go any further, just one remark. *Capital in general,* as distinct from the particular capitals, does indeed appear (1) *only as an abstraction;* not an arbitrary abstraction, but an abstraction which grasps the specific characteristics which distinguish capital from all other forms of wealth -- or modes in which (social) production develops. These are the aspects common to every capital as such, or which make every specific sum of values into capital. And the distinctions within this abstraction are likewise abstract particularities which characterize every kind of capital, in that it is their position \[*Position*\] or negation \[*Negation*\] (e.g. fixed capital or circulating capital); (2) however, capital in general, as *distinct* from the particular real capitals, is itself a *real* existence. This is recognized by ordinary economics, even if it is not *understood,* and forms a very important moment of its doctrine of equilibrations etc. For example, capital in this *general form,* although belonging to individual capitalists, in its *elemental form* as capital, forms the capital which accumulates in the banks or is distributed through them, and, as Ricardo says, so admirably distributes itself in accordance with the needs of production.[^51] Likewise, through loans etc., it forms a level between the different countries. If it is therefore e.g. a law of capital in general that, in order to realize itself, it must posit itself doubly, and must realize itself in this double form, then e.g. the capital of a particular nation which represents capital *par excellence* in antithesis to another will have to lend itself out to a third nation in order to be able to realize itself. This double positing, this relating to self as to an alien, becomes []{#p450} damn real in this case. While the general is therefore on the one hand only a mental \[*gedachte*\] mark of distinction \[*differentia specifica\],* it is at the same time a *particular* real form alongside the form of the particular and individual.[^52] (We will return later to this point, which, while having more of a logical than an economic character, will nevertheless have a great importance in the course of our inquiry. The same also in algebra. For example, *a, b, c* are numbers as such; in general; but then again they are whole numbers as opposed to *a/b, b/c, c/b, c/a, b/a* etc., which latter, however, presuppose the former as their general elements.\>

##### *Surplus labour or surplus value becomes surplus capital. All determinants of capitalist production now appear as results of (wage) labour itself. The realization process* \[Verwirklichungsprozess\] *of labour at the same time its de-realization process* \[Entwirklichungsprozess\]

The new value, then, \[is\] itself posited as capital again, as objectified labour entering into the process of exchange with living labour, and hence dividing itself into a constant part -- the objective conditions of labour, material and instrument -- and the conditions for the subjective condition of labour, the existence of living labour capacity, the necessaries, subsistence goods for the worker. With this second entrance by capital in this form, some points appear clarified which were altogether unclear in its first occurrence -- as money in transition from its role as value to its role as capital. Now they are solved through the process of realization and production itself. In the first encounter, the *presuppositions* themselves appeared to come in from the outside, out of circulation; as external presuppositions for the arising of capital; hence not emergent from its inner essence, and not explained by it. These *external* presuppositions will now appear as moments of the motion of capital itself, so that it has itself -- regardless how they may arise historically -- pre-posited them as its own moments.

Within the production process itself, surplus value, the surplus value procured through compulsion by capital, appeared as *surplus labour,* itself in the form of living labour, which, however, since it cannot create something out of nothing, finds its objective conditions laid out before it. Now this *surplus labour* appears in []{#p451} objectified form as *surplus product,* and, in order to realize itself as capital, this surplus product divides into a double form: as *objective condition of labour --* material and instrument; as subjective -- consumption goods for the living labour now to be put to work. The general form as value -- objectified labour -- and objectified labour coming out of circulation -- is of course the general, self-evident presupposition. Further: the surplus product in its totality -- which objectifies surplus labour in its totality -- now appears as *surplus capital* (in contrast to the original capital, before it had undertaken this cycle), i.e. as independent exchange value, in which living labour capacity encounters its *specific use value.* All moments which confronted living labour capacity, and employed it as *alien, external* powers, and which consumed it under *certain conditions independent of itself,* are now posited as *its own product and result.*

*Firstly: surplus value or the surplus product* are nothing but a specific sum of objectified living labour -- the sum of surplus labour. This new *value* which confronts living labour as independent, as engaged in exchange with it, as capital, is the *product of labour.* It is itself nothing other than the *excess of labour as such above necessary labour --* in objective form and hence as *value.*

*Secondly:* the particular forms which this value must adopt in order to realize itself anew, i.e. to posit itself as capital -- on one side as raw material and instrument, on the other as subsistence goods for labour during the act of production -- are likewise, therefore, only *particular* forms of surplus labour itself. Raw material and instrument are produced by it in such relations -- or, it is itself objectively posited in production as raw material and instrument in such a proportion -- that a given sum of necessary labour -- i.e. living labour which reproduces (the value of) the consumption goods -- can objectify itself in it, and objectify itself in it continuously, i.e. can always begin anew the diremption into the objective and subjective conditions of its self-preservation and self-reproduction. In addition to this, living labour, in the process of reproducing its objective conditions, has at the same time posited raw material and instrument in such proportions that it can realize itself in them as *surplus labour, as labour beyond the necessary,* and can hence make them into material for the creation of *new* values. The objective conditions of *surplus labour --* which are restricted to the proportion of raw material and instrument beyond the requirements of necessary labour, whereas the objective conditions []{#p452}of necessary labour divide within their objectivity into objective and subjective, into objective moments of labour as well as subjective (consumption goods for living labour) -- therefore now appear, are therefore now posited, as the product, result, objective form, external existence of surplus labour itself. Originally, by contrast, the fact that instrument and necessaries were on hand in the amounts which made it possible for living labour to realize itself not only as *necessary,* but also as *surplus* labour -- this appeared alien to living labour itself, appeared as an act of capital.

*Thirdly:* The independent, for-itself existence \[*FÃ¼rsichsein*\] of value *vis-Ã -vis* living labour capacity -- hence its existence as capital -- the objective, self-sufficient indifference, the *alien quality* \[*Fremdheit*\] of the objective conditions of labour *vis-Ã -vis* living labour capacity, which goes so far that these conditions confront the person of the worker in the person of the capitalist -- as personification[^53] with its own will and interest -- this absolute *divorce, separation* of property, i.e. of the objective conditions of labour from living labour capacity -- that they confront him as *alien property,* as the reality of other juridical persons, as the absolute realm of *their* will -- and that labour therefore, on the other side, appears as *alien labour* opposed to the value personified in the capitalist, or the conditions of labour -- this absolute separation between property and labour, between living labour capacity and the conditions of its realization, between objectified and living labour, between value and value-creating activity -- hence also the alien quality of the content of labour for the worker himself -- this divorce now likewise appears as a product of labour itself, as objectification of its own moments. For, in the new act of production itself -- which merely confirmed the exchange between capital and living labour which preceded it -- surplus labour, and hence the surplus product, the total product of labour in general (of surplus labour as well as necessary labour), has now been posited as capital, as independent and indifferent towards living labour capacity, or as exchange value which confronts its mere use value. Labour capacity has appropriated for itself only the subjective conditions of necessary labour -- the means of subsistence for actively producing labour capacity, i.e. for its reproduction as mere labour capacity separated from the conditions of its realization -- and it has posited these conditions themselves as []{#p453} *things, values,* which confront it in an alien, commanding personification. The worker emerges not only not richer, but emerges rather poorer from the process than he entered. For not only has he produced the conditions of necessary labour as conditions belonging to capital; but also the value-creating possibility, the realization \[*Verwertung*\] which lies as a possibility within him, now likewise exists as surplus value, surplus product, in a word as capital, as master over living labour capacity, as value endowed with its own might and will, confronting him in his abstract, objectless, purely subjective poverty. He has produced not only the alien wealth and his own poverty, but also the relation of this wealth as independent, self-sufficient wealth, relative to himself as the poverty which this wealth consumes, and from which wealth thereby draws new vital spirits into itself, and realizes itself anew. All this arose from the act of exchange, in which he exchanged his living labour capacity for an amount of objectified labour, except that this objectified labour -- these external conditions of his being, and the independent externality \[*Ausserihmsein*\] (to him) of these objective conditions -- now appear as posited by himself, as *his own product,* as his own self-objectification as well as the objectification of himself as a power independent of himself, which moreover rules over him, rules over him through his own actions.

In *surplus capital,* all moments are products of *alien labour -- alien surplus labour* transformed into capital; means of subsistence for necessary labour; the objective conditions -- material and instrument -- whereby necessary labour can reproduce the value exchanged for it in means of subsistence; finally the amount of material and instrument required so that new surplus labour can realize itself in them, or a new surplus value can be created.

It no longer seems here, as it still did in the first examination of the production process, as if capital, for its part, brought with it any value whatever from circulation. Rather, the objective conditions of labour now appear as labour's product -- both to the extent that they are value in general, and as use values for production. But while capital thus appears as the product of labour, so does the product of labour likewise appear as capital -- no longer as a simple product, nor as an exchangeable commodity, but as *capital;* objectified labour as mastery, command over living labour. The product of labour appears as *alien property,* as a mode of existence confronting living labour as independent, as []{#p454} *value* in its being for itself; the product of labour, objectified labour, has been endowed by living labour with a soul of its own, and establishes itself opposite living labour as an *alien power:* both these situations are themselves the product of labour. Living labour therefore now appears from its own standpoint as acting within the production process in such a way that, as it realizes itself in the objective conditions, it simultaneously repulses this realization from itself as an alien reality, and hence posits itself as insubstantial, as mere penurious labour capacity in face of this reality alienated \[*entfremdet*\] from it, belonging not to it but to others; that it posits its own reality not as a being for it, but merely as a being for others, and hence also as mere other-being \[*Anderssein*\], or being of another opposite itself.[^54] This realization process is at the same time the de-realization process of labour. It posits itself objectively, but it posits this, its objectivity, as its own not-being or as the being of its not-being -- of capital. It returns back into itself as the mere possibility of value-creation or realization \[*Verwertung*\]; because the whole of real wealth, the world of real value and likewise the real conditions of its own realization \[*Verwirklichung*\] are posited opposite it as independent existences. As a consequence of the production process, the possibilities resting in living labour's own womb exist outside it as realities -- but as *realities alien* to it, which form wealth in opposition to it.

In so far as the surplus product is realized anew as surplus capital, enters anew into the process of production and self-realization, it divides into (1) means of subsistence for the workers, to be exchanged for living labour capacity; let this part of *capital* be designated as *labour fund;* this labour fund, the part allotted for the maintenance of living labour capacity -- and for its progressive maintenance, since surplus capital constantly grows -- now likewise appears as the product of *alien* labour, labour alien to *capital,* as well as (2) its other component parts -- the material conditions for the reproduction of a value = to these means of subsistence + a surplus value.

Further, if we consider this surplus capital, then the division of capital into a constant part -- raw material and instrument with an antediluvian existence before labour -- and a variable part, i.e. the necessary goods exchangeable for living labour capacity, appears as purely formal, in so far as both of them are equally []{#p455} *posited* by labour and are equally posited by it as its own *presuppositions*. Now, however, this internal division of capital appears in such a way that labour's own product -- objectified surplus labour -- splits into two component parts -- the objective conditions for new realization of labour (1), and a labour fund for maintaining the possibility of this living labour, i.e. of living labour capacity as alive (2), but in such a way that labour capacity can only re-appropriate that part of its own result -- of its own being in objective form -- which is designated as labour fund, can appropriate and extract this part from the form of the alien wealth which confronts it, only by reproducing not merely its own value, but by also realizing that part of the new capital which represents the objective conditions for the realization of new surplus labour and surplus production, or production of surplus values. Labour has itself created a new fund for the employment of new necessary labour, or, what is the same, a fund for the maintenance of new living labour capacities, of workers, but has created at the same time the condition that this fund can be employed only if new surplus labour is employed on the extra part of the surplus capital. Thus, the production by labour of this surplus capital -- surplus value -- is at the same time the creation of the real necessity of new surplus labour, and thus surplus capital is itself at the same time the real possibility both of new surplus labour and of new surplus capital. It here becomes evident that labour itself progressively extends and gives an ever wider and fuller existence to the objective world of wealth as a power alien to labour, so that, relative to the values created or to the real conditions of value-creation, the penurious subjectivity of living labour capacity forms an ever more glaring contrast. The greater the extent to which labour objectifies itself, the greater becomes the objective world of values, which stands opposite it as alien -- alien property. With the creation of surplus capital, labour places itself under the compulsion to create yet further surplus capital etc. etc.

In regard to the original not-surplus capital, the relation has changed, as regards labour capacity, in so far as (1) the part of it which is exchanged for necessary labour has been reproduced by this labour itself, i.e. no longer comes to it out of circulation, but is its own product; and (2) that part of the value which, as raw material and instrument, represents the real conditions for the realization \[*Verwertung*\] of living labour, has been maintained by it itself in the production process; and, since every use value by its []{#p456} nature consists of transitory material, but since exchange value is present, exists, only in use value, therefore this maintenance = protection from decay and ruin, or negation of the transitory nature of the values owned by the capitalists; hence, this maintenance means to posit them as values for-themselves, as *indestructible wealth.* Hence, this original sum of values has been posited for the first time as capital in the production process, by living labour.

##### *Formation of surplus capital I. -- Surplus capital II. -- Inversion of the law of appropriation. -- Chief result of the production and realization process: the reproduction and new production of the relation of capital and labour itself, of capitalist and worker*

Now, from the standpoint of capital: As regards the *surplus capital,* the capitalist represents value for-itself, money in its third moment, wealth, by means of simple *appropriation of alien labour;* since every moment of surplus capital, material, instrument, necessaries, resolves into *alien labour,* which the capitalist does not appropriate by means of *exchange* for existing values, but has appropriated *without exchange.* True, the exchange of a part of *values belonging to him,* or of *objectified labour* possessed by him, for alien living labour capacity, appears as the *original precondition* for this *surplus capital.* For the formation of *surplus capital I,* if we give that name to the surplus capital emerging from the original production process, i.e. for the *appropriation of alien labour,* of *objectified alien labour,* it appears as a condition that the capitalist should possess *values,* of which he *formally* exchanges one part for living labour capacity. We say formally, because living labour must replace and return to him these *exchanged* values as well. But be this as it may. In any case, it appears as a condition for the formation of surplus capital I, i.e. for the appropriation of alien labour or of the values in which it is objectified, that there must be an exchange of values belonging to the capitalist, thrown into circulation by him, and supplied to living labour capacity by him -- of values which do *not* arise from his *exchange* with living labour, or not from his relation as *capital* to *labour.*

But now let us think of this surplus capital as having been thrown back into the production process, as realizing its surplus value anew in exchange, and as appearing anew as new surplus []{#p457} capital at the beginning of a third production process. This, *surplus capital II,* has different presuppositions from surplus capital I. The presupposition of surplus capital I was the existence of values belonging to the capitalist and thrown by him into circulation, or, more exactly, into the exchange with living labour capacity. The presupposition of surplus capital II is nothing more than the existence of surplus capital I; i.e. in other words, the presupposition that the capitalist has already appropriated alien labour without exchange. This puts him into a position where he is able to begin the process again and again. True, in order to create surplus capital II, he had to exchange a part of the value of surplus capital I in the form of means of subsistence for living labour capacity, but the values he gave in that exchange were not values which he originally put into circulation out of his own funds; they were, rather, objectified alien labour which he appropriated without giving any equivalent whatever, and which he now re-exchanges for alien living labour; in the same way, moreover, as the material etc. in which this new labour realizes itself and in which it creates surplus value have come into his hands without exchange, by mere appropriation. *The previous appropriation of alien labour now appears as the simple precondition for the new appropriation of alien labour;* or, his ownership of alien labour in objective (material) form, in the form of existing values, appears as the condition of his ability to appropriate new alien *living* labour capacity, hence surplus labour, labour without equivalent. The fact that he has previously confronted living labour as capital appears as the only condition required in order that he may not only maintain himself as capital, but also, as a growing capital, increasingly *appropriate* alien labour without equivalent; or, that he may extend his power, his existence as capital opposite living labour capacity, and on the other side constantly posit living labour capacity anew in its subjective, insubstantial penury as living labour capacity. Property -- previous, or objectified, alien labour -- appears as the only condition for further appropriation of present or living alien labour. In so far as surplus capital I was created by means of a simple exchange between objectified labour and living labour capacity -- an exchange entirely based on the laws of the exchange of equivalents as measured by the quantity of labour or labour time contained in them -- and *in so far as* the legal expression of this exchange presupposed nothing other than everyone's right of property over his own products, and of []{#p458} free disposition over them -- but in so far as the relation of surplus capital II to I is therefore a consequence of this first relation -- we see that, by a peculiar logic, the right of property undergoes a dialectical inversion \[*dialektischer Umschlag*\], so that on the side of capital it becomes the right to an alien product, or the right of property over alien labour, the right to appropriate alien labour without an equivalent, and, on the side of labour capacity, it becomes the duty to relate to one's own labour or to one's own product as to *alien property.* The right of property is inverted, to become, on the one side, the right to appropriate alien labour, and, on the other, the duty of respecting the product of one's own labour, and one's own labour itself, as values belonging to others. The exchange of equivalents, however, which appeared as the original operation, an operation to which the right of property gave legal expression, has become turned round in such a way that the exchange by one side is now only illusory, since the part of capital which is exchanged for living labour capacity, firstly, is itself *alien labour,* appropriated without equivalent, and, secondly, *has to be replaced with a surplus by living labour capacity,* is thus in fact not consigned away, but merely changed from one form into another. The relation of exchange has thus dropped away entirely, or is a *mere semblance.* Furthermore, the right of property originally appeared to be based on one's own labour. Property now appears as the right to alien labour, and as the impossibility of labour appropriating its own product. The complete separation between property, and, even more so, wealth, and labour, now appears as a consequence of the law which began with their identity.

Finally, the result of the process of production and realization is, above all, the reproduction and new production of the *relation of capital and labour itself,* of *capitalist and worker.* This social relation, production relation, appears in fact as an even more important result of the process than its material results. And more particularly, within this process the worker produces himself as labour capacity, as well as the capital confronting him, while at the same time the capitalist produces himself as capital as well as the living labour capacity confronting him. Each reproduces itself, by reproducing its other, its negation. The capitalist produces labour as alien; labour produces the product as alien. The capitalist produces the worker, and the worker the capitalist etc.

##### Original accumulation of capital. *(The real accumulation). -- Once developed historically, capital itself creates the conditions of its existence (not as conditions for its arising, but as results of its being). -- (Performance of personal services, as opposed to wage labour.) -- Inversion of the law of appropriation. Real alien relation* \[Fremdheit\] *of the worker to his product. Division of labour. Machinery etc.*

Once production founded on capital is presupposed -- money has become transformed into capital actually only at the *end of the first production* process, which resulted in its reproduction and in the new production of surplus capital I; surplus capital I, however, is itself *posited,* realized as surplus capital, only when it has produced surplus capital II, i.e. as soon as those presuppositions of money, while it is in the process of passing over into capital, which still lie outside the movement of *real* capital have vanished, and when capital has therefore itself posited, and posited in accordance with its immanent essence, the conditions which form its point of departure in production -- \[then\] the condition that the capitalist, in order to posit himself as capital, must bring values into circulation which he created with his own labour -- or by some other means, excepting only already available, previous wage labour -- belongs among the antediluvian conditions of capital, belongs to its *historic presuppositions,* which, precisely as such *historic* presuppositions, are past and gone, and hence belong to the *history of its formation,* but in no way to its *contemporary* history, i.e. not to the real system of the mode of production ruled by it. While e.g. the flight of serfs to the cities is one of the *historic* conditions and presuppositions of urbanism, it is not a *condition,* not a moment of the reality of developed cities, but belongs rather to their *past* presuppositions, to the presuppositions of their becoming which are suspended in their being. The conditions and presuppositions of the *becoming,* of the *arising,* of capital presuppose precisely that it is not yet in being but merely in *becoming;* they therefore disappear as real capital arises, capital which itself, on the basis of its own reality, posits the conditions for its realization. Thus e.g. while the process in which money or value for-itself originally becomes capital presupposes on the part of the capitalist an accumulation -- perhaps by means of savings garnered from products and values created by his own labour etc., which he has undertaken as a *not-capitalist,* i.e. while the presuppositions under which money becomes capital []{#p460}appear as given, external *presuppositions* for the arising of capital -- \[nevertheless,\] as soon as capital has become capital as such, it creates its own presuppositions, i.e. the possession of the real conditions of the creation of new values *without exchange --* by means of its own production process. These presuppositions, which originally appeared as conditions of its becoming -- and hence could not spring from its *action as capital --* now appear as results of its own realization, reality, as *posited by it -- not as conditions of its arising, but as results of its presence.* It no longer proceeds from presuppositions in order to become, but rather it is itself presupposed, and proceeds from itself to create the conditions of its maintenance and growth. Therefore, the conditions which preceded the creation of surplus capital I, or which express the becoming of capital, do not fall into the sphere of that mode of production for which capital serves as the presupposition; as the historic preludes of its becoming, they lie behind it, just as the processes by means of which the earth made the transition from a liquid sea of fire and vapour to its present form now lie beyond its life as finished earth. That is, individual capitals can continue to arise e.g. by means of hoarding. But the hoard is transformed into capital only by means of the exploitation of labour. The bourgeois economists who regard capital as an eternal and *natural* (not historical) form of production then attempt at the same time to legitimize it again by formulating the conditions of its becoming as the conditions of its contemporary realization; i.e. presenting the moments in which the capitalist still appropriates as not-capitalist -- because he is still becoming -- as the very conditions in which he appropriates *as capitalist.* These attempts at apologetics demonstrate a guilty conscience, as well as the inability to bring the mode of appropriation of capital as capital into harmony with the *general laws of property* proclaimed by capitalist society itself. On the other side, much more important for us is that our method indicates the points where historical investigation must enter in, or where bourgeois economy as a merely historical form of the production process points beyond itself to earlier historical modes of production. In order to develop the laws of bourgeois economy, therefore, it is not necessary to write the *real history of the relations of production*. But the correct observation and deduction of these laws, as having themselves become[^55] in history, always []{#p461} leads to primary equations -- like the empirical numbers e.g. in natural science -- which point towards a past lying behind this system. These indications \[*Andeutung*\], together with a correct grasp of the present, then also offer the key to the understanding of the past -- a work in its own right which, it is to be hoped, we shall be able to undertake as well.[^56] This correct view likewise leads at the same time to the points at which the suspension of the present form of production relations gives signs of its becoming -- foreshadowings of the future. Just as, on one side the pre-bourgeois phases appear as *merely historical,* i.e. suspended presuppositions, so do the contemporary conditions of production likewise appear as engaged in *suspending themselves* and hence in positing the *historic presuppositions* for a new state of society.

Now, if we initially examine the relation such as it has become, value having become capital, and living labour confronting it as mere use value, so that living labour appears as a mere means to realize objectified, dead labour, to penetrate it with an animating soul while losing its own soul to it -- and having produced, as the end-product, alien wealth on one side and \[, on the other,\] the penury which is living labour capacity's sole possession -- then the matter is simply this, that the process itself, in and by itself, posits the real objective conditions of living labour (namely, material in which to realize itself, instrument with which to realize itself, and necessaries with which to stoke the flame of living labour capacity, to protect it from being extinguished, to supply its vital processes with the necessary fuels) and posits them as alien, independent existences -- or as the mode of existence of an *alien person,* as self-sufficient values for-themselves, and hence as values which form wealth alien to an isolated and subjective labour capacity, wealth of and for the capitalist. The objective conditions of living labour appear as *separated, independent* \[*verselbstÃ¤ndigte*\] values opposite living labour capacity as subjective being, which therefore appears to them only as a value of *another kind* (not as value, but different from them, as use []{#p462} value). Once this separation is given, the production process can only produce it anew, reproduce it, and reproduce it on an expanded scale. How it does this, we have seen. The objective conditions of living labour capacity are presupposed as having an existence independent of it, as the objectivity of a subject distinct from living labour capacity and standing independently over against it; the reproduction and *realization* \[*Verwertung*\], i.e. the expansion of these *objective conditions,* is therefore at the same time their own reproduction and new production as the wealth of an alien subject indifferently and independently standing over against labour capacity. What is reproduced and produced anew \[*neuproduziert*\] is not only the *presence* of these objective conditions of living labour, *but also their presence as independent values, i.e. values belonging to an alien subject, confronting this living labour capacity.* The objective conditions of labour attain a subjective existence *vis-Ã -vis* living labour capacity -- capital turns into capitalist; on the other side, the merely subjective presence of the labour capacity confronted by its own conditions gives it a merely indifferent, objective form as against them -- it is merely a *value* of a particular use value *alongside* the conditions of its own realization \[*Verwertung*\] as *values* of another use value. Instead of their being realized \[*realisiert*\] in the production process as the conditions of its realization \[*Verwirklichung*\], what happens is quite the opposite: it comes out of the process as mere condition for *their* realization \[*Verwertung*\] and preservation as values for-themselves opposite living labour capacity. The material on which it works is *alien* material; the instrument is likewise an *alien* instrument; its labour appears as a mere accessory to their substance and hence objectifies itself in things not *belonging to it.* Indeed, living labour itself appears as *alien vis-Ã -vis* living labour capacity, whose labour it is, whose own life's expression \[*LebensÃ¤usserung*\] it is, for it has been surrendered to capital in exchange for objectified labour, for the product of labour itself. Labour capacity relates to its labour as to an alien, and if capital were willing to pay it *without* making it labour it would enter the bargain with pleasure. Thus labour capacity's own labour is as alien to it -- and it really is, as regards its direction etc. -- as are material and instrument. Which is why the product then appears to it as a combination of alien material, alien instrument and alien labour -- as *alien property,* and why, after production, it has become poorer by the life forces expended, but otherwise begins []{#p463} the drudgery anew, existing as a mere subjective labour capacity separated from the conditions of its life. The recognition \[*Erkennung*\] of the products as its own, and the judgement that its separation from the conditions of its realization is improper -- forcibly imposed -- is an enormous \[advance in\] awareness \[*Bewusstsein*\], itself the product of the mode of production resting on capital, and as much the knell to its doom as, with the slave's awareness that he *cannot be the property of another,* with his consciousness of himself as a person, the existence of slavery becomes a merely artificial, vegetative existence, and ceases to be able to prevail as the basis of production.

However, if we consider the original relation, before the entry of money into the self-realization process, then various conditions appear which have to have arisen, or been given historically, for money to become capital and labour to become capital-positing, capital-creating labour, wage labour. *(Wage labour,* here, in the strict economic sense in which we use it here, and no other -- and we will later have to distinguish it from other forms of labour for day-wages etc. -- is capital-positing, capital-producing labour, i.e. living labour which produces both the objective conditions of its realization as an activity, as well as the objective moments of its being as labour *capacity,* and produces them as alien powers opposite itself, as *values for-themselves, independent of it.)* The essential conditions are themselves posited in the relation as it appears originally: (1) on the one side the presence of living labour capacity as a merely *subjective* existence, separated from the *conditions* of living labour as well as from the *means of existence, the necessary goods,* the means of self-preservation of living *labour capacity;* the living possibility of labour, on the one side, in this complete abstraction; (2) the value, or objectified labour, found on the other side, must be an accumulation of use values sufficiently large to furnish the objective conditions not only for the production of the products or values required to reproduce or maintain living labour capacity, but also for the absorption of surplus labour -- to supply the objective material for the latter; (3) a free exchange relation -- money circulation -- between both sides; between the extremes a relation founded on exchange values -- not on the master--servant relation -- i.e., hence, production which does not directly furnish the producer with his necessaries, but which is mediated through exchange, and which cannot therefore usurp alien labour directly, but must buy it, []{#p464} exchange it, from the worker himself; finally (4) one side -- the side representing the objective conditions of labour in the form of independent values for-themselves -- must present itself as *value,* and must regard the positing of value, self-realization, money-making, as the ultimate purpose -- not direct consumption or the creation of use value.

So long as *both* sides exchange their labour with one another in the form of *objectified* labour, the relation is impossible; it is likewise impossible if *living labour capacity* itself appears as the property of the other side, hence as not engaged in exchange. (The fact that slavery is possible at individual points within the bourgeois system of production does not contradict this. However, slavery is then possible there only because it does not exist at other points; and appears as an anomaly opposite the bourgeois system itself.)

The conditions under which the relation appears at the origin, or which appear as the historic presuppositions of its becoming, reveal at first glance a two-sided character -- on one side, dissolution of lower forms of living labour; on the other, dissolution of happier forms of the same.

The first presupposition, to begin with, is that the relation of slavery or serfdom has been suspended. Living labour capacity belongs to itself, and has disposition over the expenditure of its forces, through exchange. Both sides confront each other as persons. *Formally,* their relation has the equality and freedom of exchange as such. As far as concerns the legal relation, the fact that this form is a mere *semblance,* and a *deceptive semblance,* appears as an *external* matter. What the free worker sells is always nothing more than a specific, particular measure of force-expenditure \[*KraftÃ¤usserung*\]; labour capacity as a totality is greater than every particular expenditure. He sells the particular expenditure of force to a particular capitalist, whom he confronts as an independent *individual.* It is clear that this is not his relation to the existence of capital as capital, i.e. to the capitalist class. Nevertheless, in this way everything touching on the individual, real person leaves him a wide field of choice, of arbitrary will, and hence of formal freedom. In the slave relation, he belongs to the *individual, particular* owner, and is his labouring machine. As a totality of force-expenditure, as labour capacity, he is a thing \[*Sache*\] belonging to another, and hence does not relate as subject to his particular expenditure of force, nor to the act of living []{#p465} labour. In the serf relation he appears as a moment of property in land itself, is an appendage of the soil, exactly like draught-cattle. In the slave relation the worker is nothing but a living labour-machine, which therefore has a value for others, or rather is a value. The totality of the free worker's labour capacity appears to him as his property, as one of his moments, over which he, as subject, exercises domination, and which he maintains by expending it. This to he developed later under wage labour.

The exchange of objectified labour for living labour does not yet constitute either capital on one side or wage labour on the other. The entire class of so-called *services* from the bootblack up to the king falls into this category. Likewise the free day-labourer, whom we encounter sporadically in all places where either the oriental community \[*Gemeinwesen*\] or the western commune \[*Gemeinde*\] consisting of free landowners dissolves into individual elements -- as a consequence of increase of population, release of prisoners of war, accidents by which the individual is impoverished and loses the objective conditions of his self-sustaining labour, owing to division of labour etc. If A exchanges a value or money, i.e. objectified labour, in order to obtain a service from B, i.e. living labour, then this can belong:

\(1\) *within the relation of simple circulation.* Both in fact exchange only use values with one another; one exchanges necessaries, the other labour, a service which the other wants to consume, either directly -- personal service -- or he furnishes him the material etc. from which, with his labour, with the objectification of his labour, he makes a use value, a use value designed for A's consumption. For example, when the peasant takes a wandering tailor, of the kind that existed in times past, into his house, and gives him the material to make clothes with. Or if I give money to a doctor to patch up my health. What is important in these cases is the service which both do for one another. *Do ut facias* here appears on quite the same level as *facio ut des,* or *do ut des.*[^57] The man who takes the cloth I supplied to him and makes me an article of clothing out of it gives me a use value. But instead of giving it directly in objective form, he gives it in the form of activity. I give him a completed use value; he completes another for me. The difference between previous, objectified labour and living, present labour here appears as a merely formal difference []{#p466} between the different tenses of labour, at one time in the perfect and at another in the present. It appears in fact as a merely formal difference, a difference mediated by division of labour and by exchange, whether B himself produces the necessaries on which he has to subsist, or whether he obtains them from A and, instead of producing the necessaries himself, produces an article of clothing, in exchange for which he obtains them from A. In both cases he can take possession of the use value possessed by A only by giving him an equivalent for it; which, in the last analysis, always resolves itself into his own living labour, regardless of the objective form it may adopt, whether before the exchange is concluded, or as a consequence of it. Now, the article of clothing not only contains a specific, form-giving labour -- a specific form of usefulness imparted to the cloth by the movement of labour -- but it contains also a certain quantity of labour -- hence not only use value, but *value* generally, *value* as such. But this value does not exist for A, since he consumes the article, and is not a clothes-dealer. He has therefore bought the labour not as *value-positing* labour, but as an activity which creates utility, use value. In the case of personal services, this use value is consumed as such without making the transition from the form of movement \[*Bewegung*\] into the form of the object \[*Sache*\]. If, as is frequently the case in simple relations, the performer of the service does not obtain *money,* but direct use values themselves, then it no longer even seems as if *value* were being dealt in on one or the other side; merely use values. But even given that A pays money for the service, this is not a transformation of his money into capital, but rather the positing of his money as mere medium of circulation, in order to obtain an object for consumption, a specific use value. This act is for that reason not an act which produces wealth, but the opposite, one which consumes wealth. The point for A is not the objectification in the cloth of labour as such, of a certain amount of labour time, hence *value,* but rather the satisfaction of a certain need. Here A sees his money not *realized* but *devalued* in its transposition from the form of value into that of use value. Labour is here exchanged not as use value for value, but as itself a particular use value, as value for use. The more frequently A repeats the exchange, the poorer does he become. This exchange is not an *act of wealth-getting* for him, not an act of *value creation,* but of *devaluation* of the values he has in hand, in his possession. The money which A here exchanges for []{#p467} living labour -- service in kind, or service objectified in a thing -- is not *capital* but revenue, money as a medium of circulation in order to obtain use value, money in which the form of value is posited as merely vanishing, not money which will preserve and realize itself as such through the acquisition of labour. Exchange of *money as revenue,* as a mere medium of circulation, for living labour, can never posit money as capital, nor, therefore, labour as wage labour in the economic sense. A lengthy disquisition is not required to show that to consume (spend) money is not the same as to produce money. In situations in which the greatest part of surplus labour appears as agricultural labour, and where the owner of the land therefore appears as owner both of surplus labour and of the surplus product, it is the revenue of the owner of the land which forms the labour fund for the free worker, for the worker in manufactures (here, hand crafts) as opposed to the agricultural labourers. The exchange with them[^58] is a form of the consumption of the owner of the land -- he divides another part of his revenue directly -- for personal services, often only the illusion of services, with a heap of retainers. In Asiatic societies, where the monarch appears as the exclusive proprietor of the agricultural surplus product, whole cities arise, which are at bottom nothing more than wandering encampments, from the exchange of his revenue with the 'free hands', as Steuart calls them.[^59] There is nothing of wage labour in this relation, but it *can* stand in opposition to slavery and serfdom, though *need* not do so, for it always repeats itself under various forms of the overall organization of labour. To the extent that *money* mediates this exchange the determination of prices will become important on both sides, but it will do so for A only in so far as he does not want to pay too much for the *use value* of the labour; not in so far as he is concerned with its *value.* The essence of the relation remains unchanged even if this price, which begins as conventional and traditional, is thereafter increasingly determined economically, first by the relation of demand and supply, finally by the production costs at which the vendors themselves of these living services can be produced; nothing is essentially changed thereby, because the determination of prices remains a merely formal moment for the exchange of mere use values, as before. This determination itself, however, is created by other relations, []{#p468} by the general laws and the self-determination of the ruling mode of production, acting, as it were, behind the back of this particular act of exchange. One of the forms in which this kind of pay \[*Besoldung*\] first appears in the old communities is where an *army* is maintained. The pay \[*Sold*\] of the common soldier is also reduced to a minimum -- determined purely by the production costs necessary to procure him. But he exchanges the performance of his services not for *capital,* but for the revenue of the state.

In bourgeois society itself, all exchange of personal services for revenue -- including labour for personal consumption, cooking, sewing etc., garden work etc., up to and including all of the unproductive classes, civil servants, physicians, lawyers, scholars etc. -- belongs under this rubric, within this category. All menial servants etc. By means of their services -- often coerced -- all these workers, from the least to the highest, obtain for themselves a share of the surplus product, of the capitalist's *revenue.* But it does not occur to anyone to think that by means of the exchange of his revenue for such services, i.e. through private consumption, the capitalist posits himself as capitalist. Rather, he thereby spends the fruits of his capital. It does not change the nature of the relation that the proportions in which revenue is exchanged for this kind of living labour are themselves determined by the general laws of production.

As we have already mentioned in the section on *money,*[^60] it is here rather the performer of the service who actually posits *value;* who transposes a use value -- a certain kind of labour, service etc. -- into *value, money.* Hence in the Middle Ages, those who are oriented towards the production and accumulation of money proceed partly not from the side of the consuming landed nobility, but quite the opposite, from the side of living labour; they accumulate and thus become capitalists, [Î´ÏÎ½Î¬Î¼ÎµÎ¹]{lang="grc"}, for a later period. The emancipated serf becomes, in part, the capitalist.

It thus does not depend on the general relation, but rather on the natural, particular quality of the service performed, whether the recipient of payment receives it as day-wages, or as an honorarium, or as a sinecure -- and whether he appears as superior or inferior in rank to the person paying for the service. However, with the presupposition of capital as the dominant power, all these relations become more or less *dishonoured.* But this does not []{#p469} belong here yet -- this *demystification* \[*EntgÃ¶tterung*\] of personal services, regardless of the lofty character with which tradition may have poetically endowed them.

It is not, then, simply the exchange of *objectified labour* for *living* labour -- which appear, from this standpoint, as two different aspects, as use values in different forms, the one objective, the other subjective -- which constitutes capital and hence wage labour, but rather, the exchange of objectified labour as *value,* as self-sufficient value, for living labour as *its* use value, a use value not for a specific, particular use or consumption, but as use value for *value.*

In the exchange of money for labour or service, with the aim of direct consumption, a real exchange always takes place; the fact that *amounts of labour* are exchanged on both sides is of merely *formal* interest for measuring the *particular* forms of the utility of labour by comparing them with each other. This concerns only the *form* of the exchange; but does not form its *content.* In the exchange of capital for labour, *value* is not a measure of the exchange of two use values, but is rather the *content of the exchange* itself.

\(2\) In periods of the dissolution of *pre-bourgeois* relations, there sporadically occur free workers whose services are bought for purposes not of consumption, but of *production;* but, *firstly,* even if on a large scale, for the production only of *direct* use values, not of *values;* and *secondly,* if a nobleman e.g. brings the free worker together with his serfs, even if he re-sells a part of the worker's product, and the free worker thus creates *value* for him, then this exchange takes place only for the superfluous \[product\] and only for the sake of superfluity, for *luxury consumption;* is thus at bottom only a veiled purchase of alien labour for immediate consumption or as use value. Incidentally, wherever these free workers increase in number, and where this relation grows, there the old mode of production -- commune, patriarchal, feudal etc. -- is in the process of dissolution, and the elements of real wage labour are in preparation. But these free servants \[*Knechte*\] can also emerge, as e.g. in Poland etc., and vanish again, without a change in the mode of production taking place.

\<In order to express the relations into which capital and wage labour enter as *property relations* or *laws,* we need do no more than express the conduct of both sides in the *realization process* as an *appropriation process.* For example, the fact that surplus labour is posited as surplus value of capital means that the worker does []{#p470} not appropriate the product of his own labour; that it appears to him as *alien property;* inversely, that *alien labour* appears as the property of capital. This second law of bourgeois property, the inversion of the first -- which, through laws of inheritance etc., attains an existence independent of the accidental transitoriness of individual capitalists -- becomes just as established in law as the first. The first is the identity of labour with property; the second, labour as negated property, or property as negation of the alien quality of alien labour. In fact, in the production process of capital, as will be seen more closely in its further development, labour is a totality -- a combination of labours -- whose individual component parts are alien to one another, so that the overall process as a totality is *not* the *work* of the individual worker, and is furthermore the work of the different workers together only to the extent that they are \[forcibly\] combined, and do not \[voluntarily\] enter into combination with one another. The combination of this labour appears just as subservient to and led by an alien will and an alien intelligence -- having its *animating unity* elsewhere -- as its material unity appears subordinate to the *objective unity* of the *machinery,* of fixed capital, which, as *animated monster,* objectifies the scientific idea, and is in fact the coordinator, does not in any way relate to the individual worker as his instrument; but rather he himself exists as an animated individual punctuation mark; as its living isolated accessory. Thus, combined labour is combination *in-itself* in a double way; not combination as a mutual relation among the individuals working together, nor as their predominance either over their particular or individual function or over the instrument of labour. Hence, just as the worker relates to the product of his labour as an alien thing, so does he relate to the combination of labour as an alien combination, as well as to his own labour as an expression of his life, which, although it belongs to him, is alien to him and coerced from him, and which A. Smith etc. therefore conceives is a *burden, sacrifice* etc.[^61] Labour itself, like its product, is *negated as the labour of the particular, isolated worker.* This isolated labour, negated, is now indeed communal or combined labour, posited. The *communal or combined labour* posited in this way -- as activity and in the passive, objective form -- is however at the same time posited as an other towards the really existing individual labour -- as an *alien objectivity* (alien property) as well as an *alien subjectivity* (of capital). Capital thus represents both labour and []{#p471} its product as negated individualized labour and hence as the negated property of the individualized worker. Capital therefore is the existence of social labour -- the combination of labour as subject as well as object -- but this existence as itself existing independently opposite its real moments -- hence itself a *particular* existence apart from them. For its part, capital therefore appears as the predominant subject and owner of *alien labour*, and its relation is itself as complete a contradiction as is that of wage labour.\>

##### *Forms which precede capitalist production. (Concerning the process which precedes the formation of the capital relation or of original accumulation)*

A presupposition of wage labour, and one of the historic preconditions for capital, is free labour and the exchange of this free labour for money, in order to reproduce and to realize money, to consume the use value of labour not for individual consumption, but as use value for money. Another presupposition is the separation of free labour from the objective conditions of its realization -- from the means of labour and the material for labour. Thus, above all, release of the worker from the soil as his natural workshop -- hence dissolution of small, free landed property as well as of communal landownership resting on the oriental commune. In both forms, the worker relates to the objective conditions of his labour as to his property; this is the natural unity of labour with its material \[*sachlich*\] presuppositions. The worker thus has an objective existence independent of labour. The individual relates to himself as proprietor, as master of the conditions of his reality. He relates to the others in the same way and -- depending on whether this *presupposition* is posited as proceeding from the community or from the individual families which constitute the commune -- he relates to the others as co-proprietors, as so many incarnations of the common property, or as independent proprietors like himself, independent private proprietors -- beside whom the previously all-absorbing and all-predominant communal property is itself posited as a particular *ager publicus*[^62] alongside the many private landowners.

In both forms, the individuals relate not as workers but as proprietors -- and members of a community, who at the same time work. The aim of this work is not the *creation of value* -- although they may do surplus labour in order to obtain *alien*, i.e. surplus []{#p472} products in exchange -- rather, its aim is sustenance of the individual proprietor and of his family, as well as of the total community. The positing of the individual as a *worker,* in this nakedness, is itself a product of *history.*

In the first form of this landed property, an initial, naturally arisen spontaneous \[*naturwÃ¼chsiges*\] community appears as first presupposition. Family, and the family extended as a clan \[*Stamm*\],[^63] or through intermarriage between families, or combination of clans. Since we may assume that *pastoralism,* or more generally a *migratory* form of life, was the first form of the mode of existence, not that the clan settles in a specific site, but that it grazes off what it finds -- humankind is not settlement-prone by nature (except possibly in a natural environment so especially fertile that they sit like monkeys on a tree; else roaming like the animals) -- then the *clan community,* the natural community, appears not as a *result* of, but as a *presupposition for the communal appropriation* (temporary) *and utilization of the land.* When they finally do settle down, the extent to which this original community is modified will depend on various external, climatic, geographic, physical etc. conditions as well as on their particular natural predisposition -- their clan character. This naturally arisen clan community, or, if one will, pastoral society, is the first presupposition -- the communality \[*Gemeinschaftlichkeit*\] of blood, language, customs -- for the *appropriation of the objective conditions* of their life, and of their life's reproducing and objectifying activity (activity as herdsmen, hunters, tillers etc.). The earth is the great workshop, the arsenal which furnishes both means and material of labour, as well as the seat, the *base* of the community. They relate naÃ¯vely to it as the *property of the community,* of the community producing and reproducing itself in living labour. Each individual conducts himself only as a link, as a member of this community as *proprietor* or *possessor.* The *real appropriation* through the labour process happens under these *presuppositions,* which are not themselves the *product* of labour, but appear as its natural or *divine* presuppositions. This form, with the same land-relation as its foundation, can realize itself in very different ways. E.g. it is not in the least a contradiction to it that, as in most of the *Asiatic* land-forms, the *comprehensive unity* standing above all these little communities appears as the higher *proprietor* or as the *sole proprietor;* []{#p473} the real communities hence only as *hereditary* possessors. Because the *unity* is the real proprietor and the real presupposition of communal property, it follows that this unity can appear as a *particular* entity above the many real particular communities, where the individual is then in fact propertyless, or, property -- i.e. the relation of the individual to the *natural* conditions of labour and of reproduction as belonging to him, as the objective, nature-given inorganic body of his subjectivity -- appears mediated for him through a cession by the total unity -- a unity realized in the form of the despot, the father of the many communities -- to the individual, through the mediation of the particular commune. The surplus product -- which is, incidentally, determined by law in consequence of the real appropriation through labour -- thereby automatically belongs to this highest unity. Amidst oriental despotism and the propertylessness which seems legally to exist there, this clan or communal property exists in fact as the foundation, created mostly by a combination of manufactures and agriculture within the small commune, which thus becomes altogether self-sustaining, and contains all the conditions of reproduction and surplus production within itself. A part of their surplus labour belongs to the higher community, which exists ultimately as a *person,* and this surplus labour takes the form of tribute etc., as well as of common labour for the exaltation of the unity, partly of the real despot, partly of the imagined clan-being, the god. Now, in so far as it actually realizes itself in labour, this kind of communal property can appear either in the form where the little communes vegetate independently alongside one another, and where, inside them, the individual with his family work independently on the lot assigned to them (a certain amount of labour for the *communal reserves, insurance* so to speak, and to *meet the expenses of the community as such,* i.e. for war, religion etc.; this is the first occurrence of the lordly *dominium* in the most original sense, e.g. in the Slavonic communes, in the Rumanian etc. Therein lies the transition to villeinage \[*Frondienst*\] etc.); or the unity may extend to the communality of labour itself, which may be a formal system, as in Mexico, Peru especially, among the early Celts, a few clans of India. The communality can, further, appear within the clan system more in a situation where the unity is represented in a chief of the clan-family, or as the relation of the patriarchs among one another. Depending on that, a more despotic or a more democratic form of this community system. The communal []{#p474} conditions of real appropriation through labour, *aqueducts,* very important among the Asiatic peoples; means of communication etc. then appear as the work of the higher unity -- of the despotic regime hovering over the little communes. Cities proper here form alongside these villages only at exceptionally good points for external trade; or where the head of the state and his satraps exchange their revenue (surplus product) for labour, spend it as labour-fund.

The second form -- and like the first it has essential modifications brought about locally, historically etc. -- product of more active, historic life, of the fates and modifications of the original clans -- also assumes the *community* as its first presupposition, but not, as in the first case, as the substance of which the individuals are mere accidents, or of which they form purely natural component parts -- it presupposes as base not the countryside, but the town as an already created seat (centre) of the rural population (owners of land). The cultivated field here appears as a *territorium* belonging to the town; not the village as mere accessory to the land. The earth in itself -- regardless of the obstacles it may place in the way of working it, really appropriating it -- offers no resistance to \[attempts to\] relate to it as the inorganic nature of the living individual, as his workshop, as the means and object of labour and the means of life for the subject. The difficulties which the commune encounters can arise only from other communes, which have either previously occupied the land and soil, or which disturb the commune in its own occupation. War is therefore the great comprehensive task, the great communal labour which is required either to occupy the objective conditions of being there alive, or to protect and perpetuate the occupation. Hence the commune consisting of families initially organized in a warlike way -- as a system of war and army, and this is one of the conditions of its being there as proprietor. The concentration of residences in the town, basis of this bellicose organization. The clan system in itself leads to higher and lower ancestral lineages \[*Geschlechtern*\],[^64] a distinction which is still further developed through intermixture with subjugated clans etc. Communal property -- as state property, *ager publicus --* here separated from private property. The property \[*Eigentum*\] of the individual is here not, unlike the first case, []{#p475} itself directly communal property; where it is, the individual has no property as distinct from the commune, but rather is merely its possessor \[*Besitzer*\]. The less it is the case that the individual's property can in fact be realized solely through communal labour -- thus e.g. the aqueducts in the Orient -- the more the purely naturally arisen, spontaneous character of the clan has been broken by historic movement, migration; the more, further, the clan removes itself from its original seat and occupies *alien* ground, hence enters into essentially new conditions of labour, and develops the energy of the individual more -- its common character appearing, necessarily, more as a negative unity towards the outside -- the more, therefore, are the conditions given under which the individual can become a *private proprietor* of land and soil -- of a particular plot -- whose particular cultivation falls to him and his family. The commune -- as state -- is, on one side, the relation of these free and equal private proprietors to one another, their bond against the outside, and is at the same time their safeguard. The commune here rests as much on the fact that its members consist of working landed proprietors, small-owning peasants, as the peasants' independence rests on their mutual relations as commune members, on protection of the *ager publicus* for communal needs and communal glory etc. Membership in the commune remains the presupposition for the appropriation of land and soil, but, as a member of the commune, the individual is a private proprietor. He relates to his private property as land and soil, but at the same time as to his being as commune member; and his own sustenance as such is likewise the sustenance of the commune, and conversely etc. The commune, although already a *product of history* here, not only in fact but also known as such, and therefore *possessing an origin,* is the presupposition of *property* in land and soil -- i.e. of the relation of the working subject to the natural presuppositions of labour as belonging to him -- but this belonging \[is\] mediated by his being a member of the state, by the being of the state -- hence by a *presupposition* regarded as divine etc.[^65] Concentration in the town, with the land as *territorium;* small agriculture working for direct consumption; manufacture as domestic side occupation of wives and daughters (spinning and weaving) or, independently, in []{#p476} individual branches only *(fabri*[^66] etc.). The presupposition of the survival of the community is the preservation of equality among its free self-sustaining peasants, and their own labour as the condition of the survival of their property. They relate as proprietors to the natural conditions of labour; but these conditions must also constantly be posited as real conditions and objective elements of the personality of the individual, by means of personal labour. On the other side, the tendency of this small bellicose community system drives beyond these barriers etc. (Rome, Greece, Jews etc.). 'When the auguries', Niebuhr says, 'had assured Numa of the divine sanction of his election, the pious king's first concern was not worship at the temple, but a human one. He divided the lands which Romulus had won in war and given over to occupation: he endowed the order of Terminus. All the law-givers of antiquity, Moses above all, founded their success in commanding virtue, integrity and proper custom on landed property, or at least on secured, hereditary possession of land, for the greatest possible number of citizens.' (Vol. I, 245, 2nd edition. *RÃ¶m. Gesch.*)[^67] The individual is placed in such conditions of earning his living as to make not the acquiring of wealth his object, but self-sustenance, his own reproduction as a member of the community; the reproduction of himself as proprietor of the parcel of ground, and, in that quality, as a member of the commune. The survival of the commune is the reproduction of all of its members as self-sustaining peasants, whose surplus time belongs precisely to the commune, the work of war etc. The property in one's own labour is mediated by property in the condition of labour -- the hide of land, guaranteed in its turn by the existence of the commune, and that in turn by surplus labour in the form of military service etc. by the commune members. It is not cooperation in wealth-producing labour by means of which the commune member reproduces himself, but rather cooperation in labour for the communal interests (imaginary and real), for the upholding of the association inwardly and outwardly. Property is *quiritorium,*[^68] of the Roman variety; the private proprietor of land is such only as a Roman, but as a Roman he is a private proprietor of land.

A\[nother\] form of the property of working individuals, self-[]{#p477}sustaining members of the community, in the natural conditions of their labour, is the *Germanic.* Here the commune member is neither, as such, a co-possessor of the communal property, as in the specifically oriental form (wherever property exists *only* as communal property, there the individual member is as such only *possessor* of a particular part, hereditary or not, since any fraction of the property belongs to no member for himself, but to him only as immediate member of the commune, i.e. as in direct unity with it, not in distinction to it. This individual is thus only a possessor. What exists is only *communal* property, and only *private possession.* The mode of this possession in relation to the communal property may be historically, locally etc. modified in quite different ways, depending on whether labour itself is performed by the private possessor in isolation, or is in turn determined by the commune or by the unity hovering above the particular commune); nor is the situation such as obtains in the Roman, Greek form (in short, the form of classical antiquity) -- in this case, the land is occupied by the commune, Roman land; a part remains to the commune as such as distinct from the commune members, *ager publicus* in its various forms; the other part is divided up and each parcel of land is Roman by virtue of being the private property, the domain of a Roman, the part of the *laboratorium* belonging to him; but, also, he is a Roman only in so far as he possesses this sovereign right over a part of the Roman earth. \<In antiquity, urban occupation and trade little esteemed, agriculture, however, highly; in the Middle Ages the contrary appraisal.\> \<The right of *using* the communal land through *possession* originally appertained to the patricians, who then granted it to their clients; the *transfer of property* out of the *ager publicus* appertained exclusively to the plebeians; all assignments in favour of the plebeians and compensation for a share of the communal property. *Actual property in land,* excepting the area around the city walls, originally only in the hands of the plebeians (rural communes included later.)\> \<Basis of the Roman plebs as a totality of agriculturists, as is indicated in their quiritary property. Antiquity unanimously esteemed agriculture as the *proper occupation* of the free man, the soldier's school. In it the ancestral stock of the nation sustains itself; it changes in the cities, where alien merchants and dealers settle, just as the indigenous move where gain entices them. Wherever there is slavery, the freedman seeks his support in such dealings, in which he then often gathers riches: thus these occupations were mostly in their hands in []{#p478} antiquity, and were therefore not proper for a citizen: hence the opinion that admission of the craftsmen to full citizenship rights would be a risky undertaking (among the earlier Greeks they were as a rule excluded). '[á½á½Î´ÎµÎ½á½¶ Î³á½°Ï á¼Î¾á¿Î½ á¿¾Î¡ÏÎ¼Î±á½·ÏÎ½ Î¿á½ÏÎµ Ï°Î¬ÏÎ·Î»Î¿Î½ Î¿á½ÏÎµ ÏÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¿Ïá½³ÏÎ½Î·Î½ Î²Î¯Î¿Î½ á¼ÏÎµÎ¹Î½.]{lang="grc"}'[^69] Antiquity had no inkling of a privileged guild-system such as prevailed in the history of medieval cities; and already here the martial spirit declined as the guilds defeated the aristocratic lineages, and was finally extinguished altogether; and consequently, with it, the cities' external respect and freedom.\> \<The clans of the ancient states were founded on two different principles, either on *ancestry* \[*Geschlecht*\] or on the *locality.* The *ancestral clans* preceded the locality clans in time and are almost everywhere pushed aside by the latter. Their most extreme, strictest form is the caste-order, in which one is separated from the other, without the right of intermarriage, quite different in \[degree of\] privilege; each with an exclusive, irrevocable occupation. The *locality clans* originally corresponded to a partition of the countryside into districts and villages; so that someone residing in a given village at the time of this partition, in Attica under Cleisthenes, was registered as a *demotes* (villager) of that village, and as a member of the *phylon* (tribe) of the village's region. Now, his descendants, as a rule, remained in the same *phylon* and the same *demos* without regard to their residence; whereby this partition also took on an ancestral appearance.\> \<These Roman *gens* not blood relatives; to the communal name, Cicero adds descent from free men as a sign. Communal *sacra* (shrines) for the Roman gentiles; later ceased (already in Cicero's time). Practice of co-gentile inheritance, in cases without dependents or will, survived longest of all. In the earliest periods, obligation of all members of the *gens* to help those of their own who require this, to carry unaccustomed burdens. (This occurs originally everywhere among the Germans, remains longest among the Dithmarschen.) The *gentes,* corporations \[*Innungen*\]. There was in the world of antiquity no more general institution than that of kin groups. Thus among the Gaels the noble Campbells and their vassals forming one clan.\>[^70] Since the patrician []{#p479} represents the community in a higher degree, he is the *possessor* of the *ager publicus* and uses it through his clients etc. (and also appropriates it little by little). The Germanic commune is not concentrated in the town; by means of such a concentration -- the town as centre of rural life, residence of the agricultural workers, likewise the centre of warfare -- the commune as such would have a merely outward existence, distinct from that of the individual. The history of classical antiquity is the history of cities, but of cities founded on landed property and on agriculture; Asiatic history is a kind of indifferent unity of town and countryside (the really large cities must be regarded here merely as royal camps, as works of artifice \[*SuperfÃ¶tation*\] erected over the economic construction proper); the Middle Ages (Germanic period) begins with the land as the seat of history, whose further development then moves forward in the contradiction between town and countryside; the modern \[age\] is the urbanization of the countryside, not ruralization of the city as in antiquity.[]{#iiie3}

Marx referred here to the third work, which he never produced in a completed form. Pages 459--514 of the present edition would no doubt have formed part of it.

[^65]:Â Â This is one possible reconstruction of the sentence beginning 'The commune', which has a number of grammatical loose ends in the original. Two other possible variants are presented inÂ *Pre-Capitalist Economic Formations,Â *tr. J. Cohen, London, 1964, p. 73.
